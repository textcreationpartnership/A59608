         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the next place, I count it moſt worthy of my obſervation, (not unworthy of your conſideration) that it pleaſed God to ſeize upon my Family in the beginning of harveſt; a harvest which I had too earneſtly expected, too carefully provided for, and promiſed my ſelf too liberally from which folly and vanity of mind, this Viſitation thus tim'd, did as clearly convince me of (me thought) as if I had ſeen an hand-writing upon the wall. I am aſhamed, yet I will not ſtick to confeſs before all the world (God grant it may be for the ſeaſonable and effectual warning of any!) that my vainer mind was over-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly (not to ſay eagerly) drawn out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſecular and worlaly (however ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary) employments and concernments: And thus I was rebuked.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Sermon of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, the Lord reckons up the many fearful Plagues wherewith from time to time he had aſſayed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim this perverſe people, the ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> beginning at the 6th. <hi>verſe:</hi> But ſtill concludes the relation,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100587:13"/> with a doleful <hi>Epiphonema, yet have ye not returned unto me.</hi> It is not my buſineſs to enquire into the ſeveral Plagues, either the clear meaning of them, or the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar time when they took place or ended; nor into the impenitence and ſtubborneſs of the people; though many uſeful things might be obſerved from hence. But in the concluſion, becauſe none of theſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had prevailed upon them, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to trouble himſelf with them no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but to deſtroy them utterly. All that he had done to them in the Land, had not prevailed; therefore now he will caſt them and carry them out of the Land, by the over-flowing ſcourge of an <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity: This threatning he denounces in the ſecond and third verſes, <hi>I will take you away with hooks, and your poſterity with fiſh-hooks, &amp;c.</hi> And after he had reckoned up the many calamities whereby he had ſought to bring them to repentance, but they repented not, and ſo had demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the equitableneſs of this final judgment, he reaſſumes the ſame threatning, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in his former reſolution, <hi>verſ. 12.

            <p>Which words may either be underſtood <hi>Ironically,</hi> by way of deriſion of all their vain confidences and refuges; and then the <hi>Doctrine</hi> is, <hi>That there is no ſtanding before, nor ſtriving againſt, nor flying from God when he comes to execute vengeance:</hi> Which is an excellent truth, and of great uſe. Or elſe the words may be underſtood <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> by way of exhortation. The doubt ſeems to ariſe from the ambiguous meaning of the word [<hi>Meet</hi>] The word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> ſignifies both to meet in a <hi>hoſtile</hi> manner, to aſſault, invade or grapple with, as a man meets his enemy; ſo it is uſed concerning <hi>David</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to fight with <hi>Goliah, 1 Sam. 17. 48. He ran to meet the Phill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin:</hi> And alſo to meet in a <hi>friendly,</hi> ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable manner, by way of communication, collocution, ſalutation or converſe. So it is uſed concerning <hi>Iſaac</hi> going to meet <hi>Rebekah, Gen.</hi> 24. 65. and concerning Gods meeting of <hi>Balaam</hi> to ſpeak with him, and impart his mind to him. <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 4. If we take the word in the firſt ſenſe, then it is ſpoken by way of Irony or deriſion, and ſo the meaning of the words is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Propoſition that I have laid down. If we take the words in the latter ſenſe, then it is ſpoken ſeriouſly by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100587:14"/> and ſo the meaning of them may be wrapt up into this.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That it is the duty of Gods people to ſtudy a right behaviour towards him, and to converſe with him aright in the way of his judgments, in the time of their afflictions.</hi> And in this ſenſe I ſhall take them, and proſecute them. Beſides that general, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable godly frame and behaviour which Gods people owe to him as a ſtanding du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and indiſpenſable homage; there are ſome more eſpecial behaviours and tempers which they owe to him in ſpecial caſes, and are duties <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> as the ſeaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. Particularly, there are ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial behaviours required at our hands in the time of our affliction: And theſe both 1. Towards ourſelves, as ſelf-examination, ſelf-judging, renewing of repentance, &amp;c. 2. Towards men, meekneſs, compaſſion, inſtructing, warning, comforting, &amp;c. 3. Towards God, as we ſhall ſee anon. An afflicted condition doth call for ſome more eſpecial tempers and behaviours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our ſelves and others: But theſe I am not to ſpeak unto from this Text. It is the ſouls meeting God, behaviour towards him, converſing with him, that my Text leads me to treat of, and I ſhall not vary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100587:14"/> from it. In handling of which Poſition, I ſhall take this Method. 1. Premiſe ſome things needful to be known, concerning the ſouls converſing with God: For I ſhall retain the word [<hi>converſing</hi>] throughout my diſcourſe, as being a ſingle, yet a large and ſignificant word. 2. Shew what it is for a ſoul to converſe with God; and how it comes to converſe with him. 3. Prove the doctrine, That it is our duty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God in the way of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 4. Shew particularly, how we are to converſe with God in the time of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. 5. Apply it.</p>
            <p>1. I ſhall premiſe ſome things needful to be known, that tend to clear up my way to the following diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I premiſe, That <hi>it is the great duty of man to converſe with God.</hi> I have read that it was a common precept that the Jewiſh Doctors were wont to give to the people, that they ſhould ſingle out ſome one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and exerciſe themſelves very diligently in the obſervation of it, that therein they might make God their friend, and make him a kind of amends for the breach of many others. I doubt it is a Rule that too many Profeſſors live by, who not having the genuine and generous ſpirit of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100587:15"/> true Religion, do parcel out their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into ſome little ſhreds of homage and devotion; and inſtead of conſecrating their whole lives to God, do content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſome circumſtantial and light obedience, and think themſelves people of great attainments, if they do but ſeverely tye up themſelves to hearing twice a week, and prayer twice a day, and a few other acts of more ſolemn Worſhip. Certainly this is a penurious and needy ſpirit, much unlike the generous ample, and free-born ſpirit of true Religion. The duty, the whole duty, the conſtant duty of man is to converſe with God; commended in <hi>Enoch</hi> by the name of <hi>walking with God,</hi> Gen. 5. 22. Where you may obſerve of him, that he did not only <hi>ſet out</hi> fairly with God, or <hi>take a turn</hi> or two with him, but he <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him</hi> three hundred years together. The ſame God calls for from <hi>Abraham,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame name, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. Walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and be perfect. But it is not only the command of God that makes this a duty: If there had been no expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment concerning it, yet were it the duty of every man, neceſſarily flowing from his relation of a reaſonable creature. As man is a creature, ſo he muſt needs <hi>live
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100587:15"/> upon God;</hi> and as a reaſonable creature, ſo he ought to <hi>live with him and unto him.</hi> Therefore hath God given unto man a noble rational ſoul, not only that he might talk and work, manage the creatures, and converſe with the world; but that he might converſe with the God of the world; that Infinite, bleſſed and glorious Being. This is the very end of mans Creation, as man, as a reaſonable creature: This was the end of his being created in the Image of God; and when he was fallen from this Image, this was the end of his Redemption by Chriſt Jeſus, that Heaven and Earth might be reconciled, and thoſe that were far off might be brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igh; ſin is a ſinking of the ſoul down to ſelf and the creature: And redemption from ſin is nothing elſe but a recovery of the ſoul into a ſtate of favour and fellowſhip with God. So that whatever is expreſſed by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> is contained in this one word, <hi>Converſe with God.</hi> It is the great, the neceſſary, and as I may ſay, the natural duty of the Reaſonable Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is the higheſt priviledge of man.</hi> The <hi>Prerogative</hi> of man above the beaſts is his <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and the <hi>Glory</hi> of reaſon is, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100587:16"/> it is <hi>capable</hi> of knowing, loving, enjoying, and converſing with the Supreme and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Good. The priviledge of Reaſon is not (as too many think) that it is capable of underſtanding Arts and Sciences; that it is capable of climbing up into the nature and courſe of the Heavens, and diving into the ſecret depths of the Earth, and Sea, and the creatures therein contained; but in converſing with the Infinite and Glorious God. How miſerably do vulgar ſouls abuſe this noble faculty, who exerciſe it only in diſcourſing, numbring, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poor con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> cernments of the world and the body! Yea, certainly thoſe wiſe men, thoſe <hi>Scribes,</hi> thoſe <hi>Diſputers of this world,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls them, who cry up this faculty and glory ſo much in it, and yet do not exerciſe it about that high and eternal Being, do not converſe with God in pure affections, and God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and converſations, but expend thoſe vaſt treaſures of reaſon upon ſecrets in Nature, ſecrets in Art, ſecrets in State, or any other created Being, do enthrall their own ſouls, which they ſay are ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, and captivate and confine that noble principle, which they themſelves do ſo much magnifie: For ſin is certainly the great and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100587:16"/> only ſhame and reproach of an immortal ſoul: And indeed theſe men, though they put their ſouls to ſomewhat a more noble drudgery, yet are really no more happy than the vulgar ſort, who ſpend the ſtrength of their ſouls about eating and drinking, plowing or ſowing, or keeping of Cattel. What difference, I pray you, in point of true happineſs is there, between Boys playing with Pins and Points, and old mens hugging of Baggs and Lands? The nobleſt Sciences, the greateſt Commands, the moſt enriching Traffiques are as very toys in compariſon of true happineſs, as the poor dunghil-poſſeſſions of vulgar men: And the wiſe, the rich, the learned, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable of the world, that take up with an employment in this world, and with a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in themſelves, or in any creature, do as much diſgrace their own ſouls, and as truly live below their own faculties, as he doth that knows no higher good than food and rayment; no higher employment than to toil all his dayes in a ditch. For indeed, as to all things but converſing with God, man ſeems to be but equal, perhaps infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the beaſts that periſh. Doth man eat, drink, ſleep, work? ſo do they. Doth man find any ſenſual pleaſure, which the

It is a contradiction: A wicked man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with God, is as if one ſhould ſay, An ungodly man that is godly.

            <p n="4">4. <hi>It is the duty of man in all ages of life, at all times, and in all places, and conditions, to converſe with God.</hi> It is a neceſſary, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, certain, conſtant duty, ſpringing up out of the very nature and natural will of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100587:19"/> God, and out of the very nature and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and capacity of the reaſonable ſoul, binding <hi>ſemper</hi> and <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> as the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpeak, and admitting of no <hi>diſpenſation</hi> nor <hi>diminution.</hi> There is no time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is not a duty, or wherein it is leſs a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than at another time; however, we are apt to give to our ſelves many relaxations from it. The firſt <hi>fruits,</hi> nay, the very early <hi>buds</hi> of the tender ſoul, and of the ſpringing faculties; theſe are due to God, and ought to be dedicated to him, <hi>Eccleſ. 12. 1. Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth.</hi> Manhood is not allowed ſo to attend unto cares and exploits, nor old age to pains and griefs, as to neglect converſe with God: But whether young men build or plant, fight or ſtudy, or work, or marry, or manage the affairs of the houſe or of the field, all ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken and carryed on in away of converſe and fellowſhip with God: or whether old men ſit and muſe and meditate, or lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pains and grievances of decrepit age, ſtill it ought to be in the Lord. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth this duty admit of interruption, no more than of ceſſation: There is no diſpenſation given us from this duty, as in no <hi>age,</hi> ſo in no <hi>hour</hi> of our life. As we
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100587:19"/> cannot live a moment <hi>out of God,</hi> ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought we to live a moment <hi>without, God</hi> in the world. We ought continually ſo endeavour to walk in ſubſervience to and converſe with God, yea and as far as may be in a feeling converſe with him too. Holy <hi>David</hi> witneſſeth of himſelf that the fear of God was continually before his eyes, and that he did continually converſe with God; for ſo thoſe words may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <hi>Pſal. 73. 23. I am continually with thee.</hi> The like is recorded of many other Saints both in the Old and New Teſtaments; concerning whom one may well ſay as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſervants of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and with much better reaſon (1 <hi>King. 10. 8.) Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are theſe thy ſervants</hi> (O Lord) <hi>which ſtand continually before thee!</hi> Neither is it the duty of ſome few men, that have the greateſt knowledge or the moſt leaſure. For it ſprings up out of the relation of a creature, and out of the very nature of the rational ſoul; ſo that no ſoul of man is exempted from it, however many igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and profane perſons live rather in a profeſſed independance upon God. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it a duty only upon ſuppoſition of leaſure and freedom from worldly buſineſs,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100587:20"/> as ſome other things are, but is equally incumbent upon Prince and Peaſant, upon him that ſits in his cloſet, and upon him that ploughs in the field; yea they that go down unto the Sea in ſhips, ought to go up unto heaven in their hearts; and not only to converſe with the clouds (which they often do,) but above them too. A hand full of earth, and a heart full of heaven may well ſtand together: For as this duty juſtles out no honeſt buſineſs, ſo neither ſhould it ſelf be juſtled out by any. And as this high &amp; excellent duty agrees to all ages and times and perſons, ſo it agrees to all conditions too: poor men do think that rich men may well do it, and rich men think that poor men had need to do it: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity thinks it hath better things to mind than a God; and adverſity knows it hath worſe things, but it muſt mind them: plenty is too full to entertain him, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty hath enough to do to bear up under its own burden: learning knows how, but will not; ignorance ſayes it would, but knows not how; but notwithſtanding all this ſhuffling, the obligation to this duty ceaſes not: None ſo high as to be above it, none ſo mean as to be below it: For rich and poor, high and low, learned and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100587:20"/> unlearned, Prince and peaſant, though they are divided amongſt themſelves by punctilioes and leſſer differences, yet they are united in one univerſal Being, meet in one and the ſame center, agree in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon capacity of reaſonable creatures. As religion hath an intereſt and a concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the whole of the converſation, (according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phi. 3. 20. our converſation is in heaven</hi>) ſo alſo hath it a room in the converſation of every man in every capacity: No Relation, Condition, Action, Change is exempted from the powerful influence thereof: ſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle deſcribes himſelf, by his <hi>living in all good conſcience before God</hi> all along, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 1. and by his exerciſing himſelf in this thing, <hi>to have alwayes a conſcience void of offence towards God and towards men,</hi> Act. 24. 16.</p>
            <p>Now the fifth ſtep in order, would be, that <hi>It is more eſpecially the duty of Gods people to ſtudy to converſe with him aright in the way of his judgements,</hi> which is the Doctrine it ſelf, which I muſt not come to confirm, till I have ſhewed according to my promiſe in the ſecond place, <hi>what it is for the ſoul to converſe with God, and how it comes to converſe with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:100587:21"/>
            <p>Not to name thoſe too low and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notions that men ordinarily have of this high and ſpiritual matter, converſing with God, to ſpeak properly of it, is <hi>a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piex Act of the ſoul, whereby it entertains God into it ſelf, and renders it ſelf back again to him;</hi> receives impreſſions from him, and gives up it ſelf again to him; is firſt filled with him, and then empties it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You may conceive of it after the ſimilitude of a Plant, that is influenc't by the benign beams of the Sun; and in thoſe beams ſpreads it ſelf, and in the virtue and power of them grows up towards Heaven: or after the ſimilitude of a River, that is continually filled with the Ocean, and is continually emptying it ſelf into the ſame, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. This ſeems to be our Saviours elegant alluſion, <hi>Job.</hi> 4. 14. where he compares a divine and godly principle in the ſoul, to a <hi>well of water</hi> ſpringing out from God, and continually boyling and bubling up towards him—<hi>ſpringing up into eternal life.</hi> Or you may conceive of it after the ſimilitude of a Glaſs, which receives the image of him that looks into it, and reflects the ſelf ſame image that it receives. For indeed the brightneſs and beanty of holineſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100587:21"/> a godly ſoul doth ſhine as a light in the world, is nothing but a reflection of that light and brightneſs wherewith the Father of lights ſhineth into it. And ſo the beſt of men have nothing of their own to glory in; for they behold God, but it is in his own light; they love him with a love which he hath ſhed abroad in their hearts; they are therefore like him, becauſe he hath ſtampt his own image upon them: And ſo they muſt needs acknowledge concerning all their acts of love, and communion, and delight; as <hi>David</hi> did in another caſe, <hi>Of thine own we offer unto thee.</hi> This is indeed the true and noble converſe and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, wherein the life of a godly man is infinitely advanced above the life of all other men, and indeed doth nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the life of Angels: Their life is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Holy Scriptures, by a <hi>ſeeing of God, a beholding of him face to face;</hi> which we muſt not underſtand of a naked idle ſpeculation, but of a real aſſimilation ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the divine impreſſions made upon them; a beholding of him ſo as to be changed into his image. And ſuch is a godly mans life, ſpiritual life, his life of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God, conſiſting in a participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and of his Grace, and a holy
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100587:22"/> recip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ocation or reflection of affections to him; which are indeed two diſtinct acts, though originally ſpringing from the ſame fountain; for the love wherewith the ſoul loves God, is it ſelf an efflux from him: For by loving us, he inſpires a love into us; and by influences from God we become God-like. But this converſe with God is not only by the impreſſions of goodneſs from God, and the reflections of love and delight towards him; but is alſo ſeen in the various acts of the ſoul, according to the various impreſſions which God maketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoul, and ſuitable to the various oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of life; ſo we converſe with God by acts of fear, reverence, joy, confidence, ſelf-reſignation, and the like.</p>
            <p>Now, becauſe we are in the body, and ſo cannot converſe with God ſo purely, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually and immediately, as the Angels in Heaven do, therefore it hath pleaſed God to appoint unto man wayes and means of converſing with him, wherein he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to communicate himſelf to the ſoul, and ſo to draw forth reciprocal acts of communion, acts of love, fear, reverence, confidence, reſignation, dependance, and delight out of the ſame ſoul towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Now theſe wayes or means may be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100587:22"/> reduced to three heads. <hi>Duties, Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>Providences;</hi> though indeed the two firſt might be contracted into one. Firſt, I will ſpeak a word or two of <hi>Ordinances,</hi> ſuch as the Word and Sacraments; for I ſhall name no more but thoſe two. The Preaching of the Word is a way in which God doth uſually meet the ſoul, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate <hi>Life, 1 Pet. 1. 23. Light. Pſal. 19. 8. Warmth, Luke 23. 32. Growth, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 2. And the ſoul doth anſwer theſe impreſſions, <hi>as in the water face anſwereth face,</hi> by the acts of the acts of <hi>Faith, Love, Joy, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and holy <hi>Reſolution.</hi> So alſo the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacraments is a way wherein God meetech the ſoul, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth his <hi>Love, Sweetneſs, Fuln<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſs, Goodneſs, Strength</hi> and <hi>Vigour</hi> to the ſoul: and it reflects upon him in the acts of holy <hi>complacency</hi> and <hi>delight, chearfulneſs, thankfulneſs</hi> and <hi>dependence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Duties,</hi> theſe are alſo wayes of converſe with God; ſuch as <hi>Confeſſion, Petition, Thankigiving, Conference, Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Meditation, Obſervation,</hi> In all which God impreſſeth ſomething of himſelf upon the ſoul, and draws anſwerable affections of the ſoul unto himſelf, as might appear in the particular explication of them; but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100587:23"/> that would be too much a digreſſion. Only I will here note by the way, the miſtake of many low-ſpirited Chriſtians, who know no other converſe with God, than the bare performance of theſe things; this they count the very top-ſtone of a Chriſtians perfections, the very flower of the ſpiritual life. But alas, this is a groſs miſtake! There is ſure ſomething more ſweet, ſavoury, ſatisfactory in the ſpiritual life, than the dry duty: there is marrow in the bone, or elſe a holy ſoul could not cover it with ſo much ſervour. Converſe with God in duties, is a ſpiritual, favoury, filling en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, diſtinct from the duties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: This muſt needs be, except we will allow to wicked and hypocritical men the ſame dainties, that the moſt ſanctified ſouls do feed upon; and ſay, That the childrens bread is common to the Dogs, as well as them. The ſoul doth not converſe with God in duties barely when it prayes, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditates; for even godly ſouls themſelves do many times find little converſe with God in theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> when he ſuſpends the influences of his graces, or their hearts are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>logg'd or cloy'd with earthly objects, or otherwiſe indiſpoſed and ſhut up againſt him: It is not ſpeaking to God that brings
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100587:23"/> the ſoul really nigh unto him, nor bare thinking of God that advances the ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the excellent ſtate of feeling converſe with him. Even prayer it ſelf may prove many times an empty ſound, <hi>vox &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ihil;</hi> and meditation, that moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and genuine off-ſpring of the ſoul, may prove a poor dry and ſapleſs ſpeculation. It is not enough to ſet up the ſayls, but there muſt alſo be wind to fill them. But then doth the ſoul converſe with God in duties, when the dark places thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come filled with his divine light, and the empty places thereof filled with his divine love, and the low and languiſhing affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof are raviſhed and revived with the powerful inſinuations of his Almighty Grace: when God draws, and the ſoul runs; he puts in his finger by the hole of the door, and the very bowels of the ſoul are moved for him, as it is deſcribed, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 4. Then doth the ſoul converſe with God in meditation and prayer, when the Spirit of God moves upon the face of the waters, when he kiſſes it with the kiſſes of his mouth; and the ſhaking ſoul finds it ſelf marvelouſly ſettled, the doubting ſoul eſtabliſhed, the frozen heart thawed, the benumm'd affections warmed, the ſcant
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100587:24"/> and contracted capacity of it enlarged, and wonderfully widened, and its ſlow and ſluggiſh motions quickened into a lively and chearful compliance with, and purſuit of the ſupreme and ſelf ſufficient good: when the ſoul finds its leggs to run after that glorious object which is preſented to it, lifts up its hands to lay hold upon the ſtrength, the fulneſs, the faithfulneſs, the Chriſt of God; and bearing up it ſelf upon the wings of faith and love, flyes out to ſeek its reſt and happineſs; and no longer envyes the birds of the Altar, for it ſelf enters into the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies,</hi> and thorough the <hi>arms</hi> of its Mediator, throws it ſelf into the very <hi>heart</hi> of God. In a word, and that ſhall be the Word of God, then doth a ſoul converſe with God in duties, when with <hi>open face beholding the glory of God,</hi> it doth not only admire it, but it ſelf is <hi>changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame image from glory to glory, i. e.</hi> from grace to grace, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Providences:</hi> Theſe are ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way wherein the ſoul converſes with God. Now by Providences, we mean in general, <hi>the whole work of God in governing the world, and all things therein.</hi> And ſo indeed a religious enlarged ſoul, a mind freed from particular pinching Cares, low
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100587:24"/> and ſelfiſh ends, converſes with God in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and obſerving Gods ſetled courſe of governing the world. The whole Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, Earth, and Sea, and the admirable order kept up in them, do teach the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and draw up the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſoul into an obſervation and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him in them; and the pious ſoul longs to find ſome impreſſions made upon it ſelf by all theſe, and to be affected with God therein: It is not content with a bare ſpeculation, but its meditation of God in theſe is <hi>ſweet</hi> to it, as <hi>Davids</hi> were, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 34. Particularly, Gods <hi>Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mankind,</hi> as it doth moſt livelily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his infinite love, juſtice and wiſdom, ſo we ought to converſe with him therein, and in all the changes of any kind that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall man in the world, that befall all the Kingdoms of the world, the four great Monarchies of it, and all other ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Dominions; more eſpecially in all the mutations that befall the Church of God in the world, and all men of all ſects and ſorts therein, but moſt eſpecially our ſelves.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100587:25"/> God in the ſeveral changes that befall us in the world, is in general by endeavouring to ſerve the Providence of God in every change. The Providence of God <hi>ſerves it ſelf</hi> even upon wicked men, and upon all creatures that do leaſt underſtand it; but a godly man only knows how to <hi>ſerve the Providence of God</hi> in the things that befall him: He hath no private ſelfiſh intereſt of his own, but counts it his intereſt chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfully to ſerve the will of God, to be what God would have him be, to be without that which God would have him to want, and to do what God would have him do. Every wicked ſoul in the world ſets up ſome trade for himſelf, and drives on ſome particular ſelf-intereſt diſtinct from God: But a godly ſoul counts it his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt honour and happineſs to be nothing in himſelf, nor for himſelf, but is wholly at the beck of his Creator; and looking upon all his intereſt as being bound up in God, is ſollicitous for nothing elſe but to ſerve the will of God in his generation: So the life of holy <hi>David</hi> is deſcribed, <hi>Act. 13. 36. David in his generation having ſerved the will of God, i. e.</hi> the Providence of God, ſay the <hi>Dutch Annotat.</hi> tranſlating the words in this order. A good man eying nothing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100587:25"/> but the great and bleſſed God in the world, and knowing that he was not made for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but for a higher good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is only ambitious to be ſubſervient to that Infinite and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Being; herein imitating his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, who lived not to do his own will, but the will of him that ſent him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 38. and again, to ſeek the glory of him that ſent him, <hi>John</hi> 7. 18. In a word, he looks upon himſelf, not as in himſelf, but in God, and labours to become <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, wholly Gods, and to live in the world only as an inſtrument in the hands of him that worketh all things according to the counſel of his own will. That in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, for the converſing with God in all kind of changes in general. Now theſe changes are reduced to two heads, Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Adverſity. In the firſt of theſe it is our duty to converſe with God, and not with the creature comforts which we do enjoy from him, as one might ſhew at large. But I am to ſpeak of the latter, and to ſhew how we ought to converſe with God in that: But firſt I muſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that it is our duty to do it, which was the third thing I promiſed, <hi>viz. To ſhew that it is the duty of Gods people to ſtudy to converſe with him aright in the way of his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100587:26"/> Judgments, in a time of affliction.</hi> And here, I hope, I need not be at pains to prove by Scripture, that beſides the general bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of a Chriſtians life, ſome particular and more eſpecial behaviours are required of him in an afflicted ſtate; all will grant it ſure: Beſides, by that time I ſhall have declared <hi>what</hi> they are, I ſhall not need to prove <hi>that</hi> they are. Therefore for the preſent I ſhall content my ſelf to give in three or four Reaſons of it, and ſo paſs on. It is eſpecially the duty of Gods people to ſtudy to converſe with him aright in the time of afflictions.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe <hi>then eſpecially it is hard to do it:</hi> We are then very apt to be taken off from it, therefore we ſhould then eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally labour to purſue it, and perform it: We are then in eminent danger to be taken off from it; and that by theſe means.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Our ſenſes do ſet us on work to converſe with outward means,</hi> which, whilſt we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon too eagerly, we neglect and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God. This might appear by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of particular afflictions; but that would be too long. I will only inſtance in one or two for explication. The ſickneſs and painedneſs of the body, calls out the mind to ſeek after, and converſe with Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100587:26"/> bodily wants call us to ſeek after bodily ſupplies, and ſo all kind of diſtreſſes call out the ſoul to ſeek creature-relief. Call upon the ſick and languiſhing Patient to call upon, and hang upon divine help, to converſe with God: alas, he hath enough to do to attend upon his pains and pangs; tell him of eaſe, of recovery, and he can hearken to you, for that's the news that he longs to hear. Call upon the poor pined beggar to ſeek relief of God, to converſe with him: Alas, he finds ſuch a faintneſs in his limbs, ſuch a gnawing of hunger, ſuch a reſtleſs appetite within himſelf, that he can groan out nothing, but <hi>Oh that one would give me bread to eat!</hi> In a word, the ſoul is more naturally addicted to mind its body to which it is joyned, than the God that joyned it to that body. Hence you may obſerve two things by the way, <hi>viz</hi> 1. The reaſon why ſo few perſons repent in time of ſickneſs; the ſenſe of ſickneſs drowns the ſenſe of ſin. 2. The reaſon why ſo few poor people who are ever more conflicting with the neceſſities of the body, do not at all mind the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their ſouls: The exigencies and ſtraits of the body, do cry louder in their hearts than all the words and works of God.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100587:27"/> So that as health is the beſt time for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſo it ſeemeth that the beſt way to <hi>teach</hi> the poor, is to <hi>relieve</hi> them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The corruptions of the heart are then moſt apt to make war againſt Heaven.</hi> This is the opinion of him who knows the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of man too well, <hi>Job. 1. 11. Put forth thine hand againſt him, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> And I am perſwaded that the Devil acts much by this obſervation; which makes him endeavour all he can to make many good men poor, thinking thereby to make them leſs good: though the wiſe and merciful God do won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully prevent him. For indeed the ſoul is ſo naturally tender of the body, that its loth God himſelf ſhould touch it; if he do, it is ready to fret and ſtorm, and flye in his face. Converſe with God! ſaith the wicked King, <hi>Why this evil is from the Lord; what ſhould I wait upon the Lord any longer!</hi> 2 King. 6. 33. There are many corruptions of the ſoul that are moſt ready to clamour againſt God in a time of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, as <hi>Fear, Anger, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> yea and ſinful <hi>Self-love</hi> and <hi>Creature-love,</hi> an affection than can never be taught to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God, yet will go crying after him, when he takes away any darling from
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100587:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> it, as <hi>Phaltiel</hi> went crying after his Wife, or rather, crying againſt him; as <hi>Micah</hi> cryed againſt the men of <hi>Dan,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Ye have taken away my Gods, and are gone away, and what have I more?</hi> Judg. 18. 24.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Temptations do then come ſtrongeſt from without. Then it is the Devils time to play his game: What, put up this reproach! what, will you ſit down with this loſs! up and revenge thy ſelf. He that knows ſo well the temper of mans heart ſo ready <hi>to curſe God when he touches him,</hi> Job 2. 5. will not fail <hi>to touch</hi> the heart, and tempt it <hi>to curſe him</hi> indeed, <hi>Job 2. 9.—Curſe God and dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have gone thorow the Doctrinal part of my diſcourſe upon theſe words, which was the thing I mainly intended. Many Inferences might be drawn from it. But I ſhall content my ſelf to forbid, and ſo as it were to remove out of the way, ſome things that hinder this great duty; and ſo ſhut up all with one word of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Converſe not with creature comforts,</hi> the poor, low, and ſcant enjoyments of this world: For ſo I may well call them, though they be never ſo <hi>high</hi> in the <hi>opinion</hi> of them that have them, and never ſo <hi>large</hi> as to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100587:28"/> the <hi>proportion</hi> that any one hath of them: They are low in compariſon of that high and ſup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eme good for which the ſoul was made; and ſcant as to any real happineſs or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction that they can poſſibly give. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thoſe ſinful and ſenſual ſouls that take up their reſt and happineſs moſt in them, are not properly ſatisfied, but ſurfeited; not filled, but for the preſent glutted with them. There are many unlawful, and hurtful wayes of the ſouls converſing with created comforts: I will not run thorow them all, as not intending any large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon theſe heads. Converſe not with them, fondly delighting in them, and doating upon them: eſpecially take heed of this when God is ſhaking his Rod over any of them. Doth God ariſe and begin to plead with you in judgment, laying his hand upon any of theſe, and threatning to take them from you? Oh then <hi>hands off!</hi> touch them not. What an unſeemly, and indeed monſtrous fight is it to ſee a creature pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling &amp; tugging againſt his Creator &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his ſuppoſed right againſt Heaven its ſelf! Is it for a Heaven-born ſoul to ſtand gazing and doating upon, or paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately weeping over created friends, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal liberty, corporal health, houſes made
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100587:28"/> with hands, things below God, yea and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low its ſelf too! Pore not too much upon them; value them only in God, and refer them freely to him. If you can ſay, you have any thing of your own, make much of it, and ſpare not: But give unto God the things that are Gods; and by that time you have done ſo, I think you need not dote upon what's left. We ought indeed at all times to enjoy all our creature comforts with hearts looſened from them: but if formerly our hearts have been too much joyned to them, it is time now to looſen them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Converſe not with creature cauſes in a time of Affliction. This is a ſtrange kind of Atheiſtical temper, into which we are very prone to fall: I ſpeak properly, when I ſay [Fall;] for it is indeed a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down from God in our hearts, in whoſe Infinite Eſſence all creature-cauſes are lapt up; and in whoſe hand the ſeveral ſucceſſes and events of them all do lie. Let a beaſt that judges by ſenſe, kick at the poor thorn that pricks him: But let ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſouls fix upon the higheſt and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Agent, who in an infinite, powerful and skilful manner, uſes what creature he will, for what end he will, and ſends it of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100587:29"/> an errand which it ſelf knows not. Why do we run hunting Poor Partridge inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the mountains of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Shall the noble faculties of an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſoul ſpend themſelves upon ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition? or is it juſt to purſue an innocent creature out of breath for being an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the hand of God; to quarrel with the Sword, becauſe it ſuffered its ſelf to be drawn; or beat the Air, becauſe it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected? This were indeed to go out with the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with much warlike pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, to catch Fleas. I deny not but that wiſe men may look into ſecond cauſes, and make many profitable Obſervations from them, both for preſent, and future; and all men may and ought to learn many wholeſome leſſons even from the inſtrument that afflicts them: But ſure I am, a godly man will not dwell upon theſe; he will not fix here, but readily reſolve all into an higher cauſe, and ſo falls to converſe with that: Much leſs will he blame or murmure at a poor harmleſs Arrow, that flew no further than it was ſhot, nor pierced no deeper than it was bidden. Yea, though the ſecond cauſe were a ſinful cauſe, a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Agent, and ſo conſequently acted by malicious and evil principles; yet a godly
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100587:29"/> ſoul knows how to diſtinguiſh upon him, and his action: he hates him as a ſinner; but comports well enough with him as Gods inſtrument: and though he condemns his action as it varies from Gods command, yet he approves of it as being ordered by Gods hand and counſel. <hi>David</hi> hated curſing, as much as any man; yet did he ſo eye the hand of God in every thing, and comply with it too, that there was a time when he ſaid concerning <hi>Shimei, So let him curſe.</hi> Concerning this I hinted ſomething before under another head. Therefore</p>
            <p n="3">3. Converſe not with <hi>creature-cures, creature-relief.</hi> Theſe may indeed be lookt out after, and ſafely made uſe of when they are found: Nay, I will add further, that they are to be ſought diligently, and uſed carefully. They that know the Infinite Soveraignty, Power and Wiſdom of God, will not tye him to means, much leſs to theſe or thoſe particular means: But on the other hand, they that underſtand Gods uſual and ordinate way of acting and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, and upholding the world, will not tye him up from means; no, nor expect that he ſhould appear for their relief im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and miraculouſly. Though if any one have a miraculous faith truly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100587:30"/> grounded upon ſome ſpecial and particular promiſe, I will not contend with him: only I would deſire to ſee his miraculous faith juſtified by ſome miraculous works, which I conceive do alwayes attend it. But the converſe with creature-cures which I forbid, is the immoderate ſeeking of them, or the inordinate uſing of them. To ſeek after means in themſelves unlawful, can never become lawful: But I ſpeak not of theſe. For, although ſome are come to that height of Atheiſm and abjuration of God, as to retain the Devil himſelf for counſelf in a time of ſtraits, as <hi>Saul</hi> did, and contract with the Prince of death for the preſervation of life in time of ſickneſs, as <hi>Ahaziah</hi> did: And I doubt very many do fall into acquaintance with that evil ſpirit, and receive aſſiſtance from him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be well aware, by medling with unphyſical, unſcriptural, unwarrantable cures: yet the greateſt danger is not in theſe: <hi>in licit is perimus omnes,</hi> the greateſt danger is of miſcarrying about things in themſelves lawful. And that is chiefly by thoſe two wayes which I named but now. Take heed therefore of immoderate ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after created helps. Be not anxious, perplexed, tormented in mind by a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100587:30"/> deſire of any of theſe. Oh what a raging and unquenchable thirſt have many men after creature cures! They will move Heaven and Earth, and almoſt Hell too (with her in the Poet) but they will find out relief. Give me a Phyſician, or I dye, ſayes one; Give me trading, good Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, a plentiful Crop, or I am undone, ſayes another. What man, is thy life lapt up in a pill, or incorporated into a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Is thy main happineſs in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of theſe things here below? or wilt thou ſay to the wind, Blow here in this quarter, and nowhere elſe; tye up the ſupreme and free Agent to a form and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of working? Let not ſuch a prophane diſpoſition be found amongſt us. Again, if you have found out hopeful creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures, take heed of uſing them in an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate manner, laying ſtreſs upon them, <hi>looking earneſtly on them,</hi> as though they by their <hi>own power and proper virtue</hi> could make the lame to walk, or the ſick to recover. Eye not, much leſs depend upon the virtue of any created means as diſtinct from God. But acknowledge the powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and virtue, and goodneſs of every created Being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be the power, and virtue, and goodneſs of God in that creature; and ſo
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100587:31"/> conſequently uſe it in ſubordination and ſubſerviency to the ſupreme cauſe, who can at pleaſure let looſe or ſuſpend the influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and virtues of every ſuch means.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Converſe not with <hi>creature-loſſes</hi> in a time of affliction. The ſinful ſoul that hath ſtraggled off from God, and centred upon the creature, is alwaies intemperate and reſtleſs: If it be diſappointed in its converſe with creature-cures, and ſees that for all theſe, his comforts are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Oh then, alas, I am undone! <hi>What ſhall I do for the hundred talents!</hi> I am the only <hi>man that hath ſeen affliction; no ſorrow like unto my ſorrow:</hi> I ſhall <hi>go ſoftly</hi> all my dayes, for the <hi>joy of my heart</hi> is periſhed, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of my eyes is cut off.

It is a ſtrange thing that a ſoul ſhould live upon its loſſes: And yet how many do ſo! Their very ſoul cleaveth to the duſt, where their creature-comforts are interred; whoſe ſouls are ſo much
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100587:31"/> bound up in the creature, that they will needs live and dye together with them. If God ſmite the Gourd, and make it to wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Jonah</hi> droops, and will needs dye too, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 8, 9. If <hi>Joſeph</hi> be miſſing a while, <hi>Jacob</hi> will not be comforted; no, he will go down into the grave unto his Son mourning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 35. Who would have thought to have heard ſuch words, from ſuch wiſe men, as a Prophet and a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triach! Oh, the ſtrange and unbounded power which this unſeemly creature love hath obtained over the beſt of men! which makes me call him a happy man, almoſt more than a man, a compeer of Angels, who hath learnt to converſe with God alone. Well, converſe not with creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſes; let not your ſoul take up its lodging by the carkaſſes of your created-comforts, with <hi>Riz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They live to their loſs, who live upon their loſſes; who dwell upon the dark ſide of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation: For every dark Providence hath one bright ſide, wherein a godly ſoul may take comfort, if he be not wanting to himſelf.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:100587:32"/>
            <p>5. Converſe not with <hi>fleſh and blood.</hi> By fleſh and blood, I ſuppoſe the Apoſtle means no more than men, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if we confer with men only for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and repair to men only for comfort in a time of affliction, we ſhoot ſhort of the mark. But by fleſh and blood the Scripture elſewhere often means, man in this his ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſtate, as he is in his corruptible, mortal body; as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 50. and many other places. And in this ſenſe I ſpeak, when I ſay, Converſe not with fleſh and blood. Judge not according to your ſenſes; let not your own ſenſual appetite determine what is good or evil, ſweet or bitter: Conſult with rectified Reaſon, and not with brutiſh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; confer with Faith, and not with Fancy. Rectified Reaſon will judge that to be really good, which our ſenſual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite diſtaſts: An enlightened mind will judge that to make for the intereſt of the ſoul, and its eternal <hi>happy ſtate,</hi> which ſenſe judges hurtful to the intereſt of the body, and its <hi>animal ſtate.</hi> It is not poſſible there ſhould be any order, nor conſequently any peace or reſt in that ſoul, where the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour faculties domineer over the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, and ſenſitive powers Lord it over the intellectual; and where raging appetite,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100587:32"/> and extravagant fancy muſt clamber up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the throne to determine caſes, and right Reaſon muſt ſtoop and bow before it.</p>
            <p>Be admoniſhed to fly converſe with all theſe, if you would converſe rightly, pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, properly, comfortably with God, which is the higheſt office and attainment of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nature. Conſider what I have ſaid concerning this excellent and high employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and awaken your ſouls, and all the powers of them to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et the Lord God, and converſe with him aright in the way of his judgments. Converſe with God, with God in Chriſt, with God in his promiſes, with God in his attributes, and labour to do it not ſpeculatively, notionally, but really, practically, according as I have directed in the foregoing diſcourſe. Religion is not an empty, airy, notional thing; it is not a matter of thinking, nor of talking; but it hath a real exiſtence in the ſoul, and doth as really diſtinguiſh, though not ſpecifically, one man from another, as Rea on diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes all men from beaſts: Converſe with God is ſet out in Scripture, by <hi>living,</hi> and <hi>walking,</hi> and the like. Let me inculcate this thing therefore again, and preſs it upon you, and I ſhall finiſh all. As the way of glorifying God in the world, is not by a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100587:33"/> meer thinking of him, or entertaining ſome notion of his glory into our heads, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a real participation of his image, in a God-like diſpoſition, and holy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Joh. 15. 8. Herein is my Father glorified, &amp;c.</hi> So the way of converſing with God in his ſeveral attributes, is not a thinking of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with our ſelves, and telling one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that God is juſt, wiſe, merciful, &amp;c. though this be good: But it is a drinking in the virtue and value of theſe divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, a working of them into the ſoul; and on the other hand, the ſouls rendring of it ſelf up to God in thoſe acts of Grace which do ſuit with ſuch attributes, as in water, face anſwereth face. I do not call bare performance of duties a converſing with God: Prayer and Meditation; &amp;c. are excellent means in and by which our ſoul converſes with God; but communion with God is properly ſomewhat more ſpiritual, real, powerful and divine, according as I deſcribed it juſt now. As for example; The ſoul receives the impreſſions of divine <hi>Soveraignty</hi> into it, and gives up it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in the Grace of <hi>Self-denyal,</hi> and humble ſubjection. The ſoul receives the communications of divine <hi>Fulneſs</hi> and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100587:33"/> and entertains the ſame with <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> and <hi>Complacency;</hi> and, as it were, grows full in it. Even as the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the virtues of the Sun are anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with life, and warmth, and growth in the plants of the earth: So a ſouls con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with the attributes of God, is not an empty notion of them, or a dry diſcourſe concerning them, but a <hi>Reception of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> from them, and a <hi>Reciprocation</hi> to them: The effluxes of theſe from God, are ſuch as do beget reflections in man towards God. This is to know Chriſt, to grow up in him into all things according to that in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 6. Whoſoever ſinneth, hath not ſeen him, neither known him.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon why we ought eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to ſtudy to converſe with God in the time of afflictions is becauſe <hi>that is a time wherein we are moſt apt to think our ſelves excuſed from this duty,</hi> as if it were allowed us in our extremity to forget God, and mind our ſelves only. And that not only in reſpect of thoſe bodily ſtraits and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, which I named under the laſt head, but in reſpect of our own paſſions. When the afflicting hand of God is upon us, preſſing and grieving of us, and taking our beloved comforts from us, we are apt to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100587:34"/> indulge our own private and ſelfiſh paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, care, fear, ſorrow, complainings, &amp;c. Yea, to think we are in ſome ſenſe allowed to indulge them. How willingly do we ſuffer our ſelves to be drawn into a converſe with our ſelves, to be contracted as it were into our ſelves, and ſuffer our ſelves to be carryed down the ſtream of our own paſſions, which at other times we ſhould think it were our duty to reſiſt! Even as the heart in naturals draws home to it in a time of danger, the blood that was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed abroad in the body, as it were to defend it ſelf: ſo the heart in morals ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers home its powers and affections which were formerly beſtowed here and there, to employ them all about it ſelf in a time of ſore affliction. And we are apt to think our ſelves excuſable too in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: So that if God himſelf ſhould ask a diſtreſſed ſoul, as he did <hi>Jonah, Doſt thou well to be careful, fearful, ſorrowful, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous,</hi> becauſe of theſe afflictions, loſſes, diſtreſſes that are upon thee? it would go nigh to give him the ſame anſwer, <hi>I do well</hi> to be ſorrowful; yea, and to refuſe to be comforted. There ſeems to be allowed us ſome natural affections in caſe of extreme affliction; which, how far they are lawful,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100587:34"/> I will not now diſpute. But ſure I am, that if ſuch be allowed us, they muſt not be wild extravagants, wandring without the bounds of Religion, and Conſcience, as if God had layd the reins upon the neck of the ſoul, and given it leave to indulge it ſelf in what paſſions it would for a certain time, as the Daughter of <hi>Jephtha</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to go whither ſhe would, wailing upon the mountains for two months. We are never allowed any paſſions or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſure, that do not comply with the will of God, and conſiſt with our ſubmiſſion thereunto. But whatever they are, I find, that under the pretence of thoſe, ſome men are apt to be carryed unto ſtrange inordinacies, and commit many paſſionate outrages; and indeed the beſt of men are too prone to ſuſpend and interrupt that lively and feeling converſe with God, which they ought to maintain even when they ſmart moſt.</p>

               </gap>ger God, and yet make a ſhift to find ſome kind of reſt in their pleaſures, friends, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; ſome take comfort in their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100587:35"/> cups and companions; and indeed all are apt to fancy a contentment in creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enjoyments. But in a time of great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, all theſe are gone, or at leaſt have no favour in them; and where ſhall the weary ſoul find reſt then? Then there's no ſhew of reſt but in God alone. When all other props fail, then either catch God here, or fall. There is now nothing left to give any ſettlement or contentment to the ſoul but God alone: And in him there is eaſe to the ſick, reſt to the weary, ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſhaking, contentment to the troubled Chriſtian. Therefore converſe with God in the day of greateſt affliction; which is the ſame counſel in effect with that of our Saviour, <hi>Mat. 11. 28. Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> (2) There is need of it, <hi>to give relief to the body alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo converſing with God in a right manner, is the beſt policy, the ſureſt way to recovery, and relief. See what a ſpeedy cure there is in it, <hi>Pſal. 34. 5, 6. They looked unto him and were lightned, and their faces were not aſhamed. This poor man cryed, and the Lord heard him, and ſaved him out of all his troubles.</hi> In vain is converſing with Friends, Phyſicians, Counſellors; in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100587:35"/> vain is all creature-converſe without this: No reſt to the ſoul, no eaſe to the body in a time of affliction, without converſe with God; ſo that a man in affliction eſtranged from God, ſtragling off from God, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether miſerable. In a word, ſeparate a ſoul from God, and in proſperity his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments are low, and in adverſity the want of them is very bitter: ſo that there is good reaſon why a Chriſtian ſhould ſtudy to converſe with God in the way of his Judgments.—But the great Art is to know how. This therefore I now come to in the</p>
            <p>Fourth place, to ſhew particularly, <hi>how we are to converſe with God in afflictions.</hi> Now there are two wayes of explaining this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By ſhewing with what Attributes of God we are to converſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By what acts of the ſoul. But I ſhall bring both theſe into one.</p>
            <p>1. We ought to converſe with the <hi>abſolute and unlimited Soveraignty</hi> of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he, as a free and ſupreme Agent, doth what he will, and none can ſay unto him, <hi>What doſt thou?</hi> Dan. 4. 35. This <hi>Job</hi> often eyes and owns: Particularly, <hi>Job 9. 12. He taketh away, none can hinder him, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100587:36"/> who can ſay unto him, What doſt thou?</hi> This we muſt alſo eye often, and own heartily. This we may well argue from Gods creating of us: He that made us thus without any <hi>conſtraint,</hi> can he not, may he not make us otherwiſe, and alter us without <hi>reſtraint?</hi> So <hi>Job</hi> argues, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 21. We may alſo argue it from the ſubordinate Soveraignty, and inferiour Supremacy of men: Even a Monarch among men doth whatſoever he pleaſeth, and who may ſay unto him, What doſt thou? <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 3, 4. Yea, a very <hi>Centurion</hi> hath a kind of Soveraignty in his ſphere, over as many as are under him; he ſaith unto one man <hi>Go, and he goeth;</hi> and to another, <hi>Do this, and he doeth it,</hi> Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 8. 9. And ſhall we not then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Soveraign Power, and independant abſolute Authority in the great and bleſſed God, over the whole Creation, the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of his own hands? So the good Centurion argues, and infers, in the place laſt quoted. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, as the Apoſtle ſaith in one place, <hi>We have Fathers of our fleſh</hi> who uſe us at their pleaſure and we do not gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay their Authority; we do not ſay to our Father, <hi>What begetteſt thou?</hi> nor to our Mother, <hi>What haſt thou brought forth?</hi> Iſa. 45. 10. Nay, if theſe ſimilitudes will
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100587:36"/> not teach you, I will ſay to you, as God to the Prophet, <hi>Ariſe, go down to the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters houſe,</hi> there I will cauſe you to learn this leſſon: He maketh and marreth his veſſels of Clay, as oft as he pleaſeth; And, are not ye in the hand of the Lord, as the Clay is in the hand of the Potter? <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 6. I ſpeak the more to this, in as much as I find, that however men give God good words, and confeſs his Dominion over them and theirs, yet when it comes to it, that he touches them in any of their darling comforts, they are ready to clamour againſt him in their hearts, as if he did them ſome wrong; if not to curſe him to his face. Certainly there is ſome Atheiſtical opinion of propriety, that in ſome degree or other is apt to ſteal into the moſt devout minds: And ſure I am, we do not only barely offend, but we do our ſelves much hurt; we wound our own peace; we ſhake the ſettledneſs of our own hearts; we put our ſelves into briars: In a word, we both leſſen our creature comforts, and multiply our griefs, and aggravate our ſorrows, by calling things our own: If we had not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them to be our own, it would not have troubled us to part with them.</p>
            <p>Be ſure therefore to eye and own the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100587:37"/> abſolute and unlimited Soveraignty of God: But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hat's not all; it is not enough to believe it; we muſt converſe with it otherwiſe than by thinking of it or aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. Then do we converſe with the Soveraignty of God,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>When the powerful ſenſe of it doth ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence quarrelling, yea murmurings, yea even diſputings in the ſoul.</hi> We may indeed modeſtly contend with men concerning their dealings with us; the <hi>Potſheard</hi> may <hi>ſtrive with the Potſheard of the earth;</hi> but it muſt not ſay to the <hi>Potter,</hi> Why haſt thou made me thus? A pacate and quiet frame of heart, is a real converſing with the Soveraignty of God. So did <hi>Aaron</hi> when he held his peace, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 3. and <hi>Job,</hi> when he <hi>attributed nothing unſeemly to God,</hi> Job 1. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When the ſenſe of it doth ſuppreſs ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.</hi> This is an unruly luſt in the ſoul, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>ets up intereſts (as the Jews ſet up Princes, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 8. 4.) but not by God, yea indeed in oppoſition to him. This is the ſeditious party in the ſoul, that is alwayes
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100587:37"/> crying out, We will not have this man to rule over us: And when that darling inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt which this proud rival hath ſet up, is touched of God, and ſmitten and blaſted from Heaven, it is ready to fret and ſtorm, yea, and to think it hath reaſon to be angry. If this Son of the bondwoman were caſt out, <hi>Abraham's</hi> Family would be all of a peece, all in order, and at reſt. If this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciplin'd and perverſe ſpirit were quite ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; Oh what a calm day would it be in the ſoul! what fair and ſweet correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would there be between God and his creature! for certainly this is the <hi>Jonah</hi> that raiſes the ſtorm, and makes the great deeps of the ſoul that they cannot reſt, but do perpetually roll and toſs, yea and caſt out mire and dirt continually. But alas, I doubt this ſpirit is not quite layd, no not in the moſt ſpiritual man: the beſt of men are ready to nouriſh and hatch up ſome darling, ſome private intereſt or other of their own, dinſtinct from God, and the grand intereſt of their ſouls, which God himſelf muſt not touch; ſome Gourd or other that the cold wind muſt not blow upon. He is a bleſſed man indeed, who doth ſo underſtand that he lives and moves in God alone; and is ſo overpowered with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100587:38"/> the ſenſe of the infinite goodneſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of God, and the abſolute perfection of his divine will, as that he reckons it his greateſt perfection to be nothing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor have nothing of his own diſtinct from God, but only ſtudyes to be great in God, to be filled with God, to live to him, and for him; to enjoy all things as in and under him; who counts it his <hi>only intereſt</hi> to quit all <hi>ſelf intereſt,</hi> and particular ends, and to be freely at the diſpoſal of the higheſt mind, conformable to the higheſt good, chearfully compliant with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created will. <hi>Potiphar</hi> had ſo committed all to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in the ſenſe of his great faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, that he knew not ought he had, <hi>ſave the bread that he did eat, Gen.</hi> 39. 6. But this ſimilitude is too low: A godly ſoul ſhould commit all its intereſt, its life and livelihood, and all to God in the ſenſe of his Soveraignty, and not know ought that he hath, no not his own life, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe it in compariſon of uncreated life; as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Job</hi> 9. 21. Methinks the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of God ſpeaks ſuch language to the ſoul, and in it, as <hi>Eli</hi> to <hi>Samuel, My Son, hide nothing from me, keep nothing back of all that thou haſt,</hi> and the pious ſoul ſhould not, with fooliſh <hi>Rachel,</hi> conceal any ſelfiſh
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100587:38"/> intereſt, ſo as not to be willing to part with it, when its Soveraign Lord and Father comes to ſearch the tent; but (with allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 10.) when God comes to ferret out all ſelf-intereſts, and ſhall ask, <hi>Is there any ſuch yet with thee?</hi> ſhould be able to anſwer boldly, <hi>No,</hi> there is none. Bleſſed is the man that is in ſuch a caſe; bleſſed is the man whoſe only intereſt it is to ſerve the will of the Lord! Well, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the infinite Soveraignty of God to this end, and work it upon, and into your own hearts, that all ſelf-will may ſtoop to it: and let the main intereſt of your ſouls, be ſo planted and eſtabliſhed in your ſouls, that no other intereſt may be able to grow by it: Charm your own ſelf-will with ſuch ſevere reproofs, as this is; Either <hi>deny thy ſelf,</hi> O my ſoul, or <hi>deny thy ſelf to be a creature:</hi> either be wholly at Gods command, or call him not thy Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When the ſenſe of it doth beget Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence in the ſoul towards God.</hi> We ought not only to be ſubject to the Rod of God, but even to reverence him when he correcteth with it: and ſo not only to <hi>accept</hi> of the Rod, but to <hi>kiſs</hi> it too. And ſurely i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Fathers of our fleſh correct us, and <hi>we give
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100587:39"/> them Reverence,</hi> Heb. 12. 9. much more ought we to reverence the Soveraign Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both of fleſh and ſpirit. This is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout act of the ſoul, whereby it, looks up and adores the Infinite and Soveraign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and thinks equitable and honourable thoughts of him, even when he is in the way of his Judgments. And theſe are the proper acts of a ſoul converſing with Gods Soveraignty in the time of afflictions. When we are ſilent before him, ſubject unto him, and reverencing of him; then do we really and truly converſe with him as our Almighty and abſolute Soveraign. But Gods Authority and Prerogative, though it may ſilence, will ſcarce ſatisfie: ſuch a corrupt and rebellious paſs are our natures grown to. Therefore</p>
            <p>2. Converſe with the <hi>perfect and infinite Righteouſneſs of God</hi> in the time of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that divine perfection whereby he renders to every man what is juſt and due, and no more. This we are to eye and own, and ſincerely to acknowledge, even in the time of our greateſt extremity, after the example of <hi>Daniel, chap.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>The Lordour God is righteous in all his works;</hi> and of the godly <hi>Levites, Neh. 9. 33. Thou art juſt in all that is brought upon us, thou
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100587:39"/> haſt done right.</hi> Argue with <hi>Abraham, Gen. 18. 25. Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> Can Righteouſneſs it ſelf erre in Judgment? Shall the <hi>Timber</hi> ſay unto the <hi>Rule,</hi> Why haſt thou meaſured mee thu; or to the Line, thou art crooked? <hi>Are not my wayes equul? ſaith the Lord;</hi> Ezek. 18. 25. Are not the Lords wayes equal? let your ſouls ſay too. Be ye ſirmly perſwaded of the infinite and incorruptible Righteouſneſs and Equity of God; but that's not all; we do not then converſe with the Righteouſneſs of God, when we do believe it, or acknowledge it: a very <hi>Pharaoh</hi> may be brought to make ſuch a confeſſion, <hi>Exod. 9. 27. The Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.</hi> But then do we converſe with the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, in general, <hi>when the ſenſe of it doth give a rational ſatisfaction to the ſoul.</hi> And indeed, whereas the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God is, enough to ſilence, yet his Righteonſneſs had need to be called in to adminiſter ſatisfaction: The former is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to <hi>ſtop the mouth;</hi> but there is need of the latter to <hi>ſettle the heart.</hi> And indeed methinks it is a heart-ſettling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. For, how can the intereſt of the creature be better ſecured than in the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100587:40"/> hands of a righteous God? Where can we venture all we have, better than in ſuch a cettain and ſteady bottom? How can we better truſt our ſelves, than on ſuch firm and even ground? We will truſt our ſelves far with an upright and righteous man: and if we hear of the miſcarriage of any intereſt of ours at any time, it doth mightily calm and ſatisfie our hearts, if we are aſſured that it was in the hands of a juſt and upright perſon: Much more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and ſteady ſatisfaction may the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Righteouſneſs of God adminiſter even in the time of the greateſt affliction, if it be duly wrought into the heart. But more particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The powerful ſenſe of the Reghteouſneſs of God ſhould make us ſenſible and ſerious.</hi> It becomes us ſeriouſly to ponder, duly to weigh, and in good earneſt to lay to heart, all that is done to us by a righteous God. We uſe ſlightly to paſs by, and ſlightly to eſteem the words or actions of vain man: But it is not for nothing that the righteous God afflicts any man, in any meaſure, at any time. The voice of God, though it be not alwayes <hi>articulate,</hi> yet is alwayes <hi>ſignificant. Will a Lion roar for nothing?</hi> Surely every action of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100587:40"/> righteous God hath a meaning in it. A hair falls not from our head, nor a Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to the ground without him: Much leſs ſure do greater changes befall us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut him. And in all things he is infinitely righteous. Oh how doth this call us to ſenſibleneſs and ſeriouſneſs! How ought all the powers of the ſoul to be awakened to attention, when the righteous God utters his dreadful voice! and the whole frame of the heart and life to be compoſed under his heavy hand! Now if ever, one would <hi>ſay of Laughter, It is mad:</hi> one would reckon trifling to be a kind of prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and judge that fooliſh jeſtings do almoſt border upon blaſphemy, formerly not convenient, now not lawful. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a vain frothy, light, trifling ſpirit, in the day of affliction, is in a ſenſe a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Righteouſneſs of God. As a conſequent of this,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It ſhould put us upon ſelf examination.</hi> Nature it ſelf had taught the Heatheniſh Mariners to enquire where the fault was in a ſtorm. <hi>Jonah</hi> 1. 7. Much more may the knowledge of Gods Infinite Righteouſneſs teach us: ſo may the holy Word too, that word in <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 40. <hi>Let us ſearch and try our wayes, &amp;c.</hi> and many others. Now
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100587:41"/> do the faculties of the godly ſoul, being awakened, begin to caſt lots upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to find out the guilty party: And certainly God hath a great hand in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe lots; he doth ordinarily <hi>ſhew unto man his ſin,</hi> even by the verdict of his own heart. Conſcience, I mean, is Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent in the ſoul; and though its true, this Judge is oft-times corrup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I believe they hit the nayl upon the head, who cryed out one to another, <hi>Verily we are guilty concerning our Brother,</hi> Gen. 42. 21. Another cryes, Verily I am guilty concerning my Miniſter, concerning my People; guilty concerning my Wife, concerning my Children, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my Eſtate, my Time, my Talents; and it may be all true. I believe the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then was in the right, who lookt upon his hands and feet, and cryed out, <hi>Judg. 1. 7. As I have done, ſo God hath requited me:</hi> and the Babyloniſh Monarch harpt upon a right ſtring after he was come to his right wits again, <hi>Dan. 4. ult.—Thoſe that walk in pride, he is able to abaſe.</hi> God hath not given to our faculties any infallibility in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100587:41"/> but he inables them to make good gueſſes; and I am verify perſwaded, doth many times lay the hand upon the right ſore, and order this ſecret Lottery from Heaven: So that that faculty, or that frame, or that action which ſtands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed in the Court of Conſcience, is ſeldom held guiltleſs in the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It ſhould work us to Humiliation and Reformation; an heart broken, and a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation healed of its breaches.</hi> By Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I mean, a heart broken purely, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and ſpiritually for ſin. I do not mean by it, an heart broken for loſſes and afflictions, and bowing down it ſelf heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the burden of its diſtreſſes: no, nor a heart broken for ſin, as viewing it only in the calamitous effects, and bitter fruits of it; which I doubt is the Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of moſt. Many may ſay concerning their Humiliation, (to uſe the Prophets words in a different ſenſe, <hi>Zach. 13. 6.) Theſe are the wounds with which I was wounded in the houſe of my friends,</hi> by the loſs of my friends, the loſs of my health, the loſs of my goods; theſe tears that you ſee, theſe groans that you hear, are nothing but the ſcarr which the ſoar hath left behind it, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100587:42"/> the wales which the Rod hath made. I doubt our very ſorrow for ſin, in a time of affliction, admits of a mixture of carnal ſelf and paſſion, and ſo of ſin too. But I mean, a pure, ſpiritual, proper ſorow, and hatred of ſin; which I know may be broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſharp afflictions, and have vent given to it by piercing the veſſel; but that is not the proper cauſe and ground of it. <hi>Moſes</hi> in his joy, had an eye to the <hi>recompence of reward, Heb.</hi> 11. 26. And ſo a Chriſtian in his ſorrow may have reſpect to the <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his ſin,</hi> I mean, his afflictions; but it is not primarily and principally cauſed by theſe: For though theſe dreadful ſhowers from Heaven ſhould ceaſe, yet the ſtream of his eyes, or at leaſt the fountain of his heart would not ceaſe iſſuing forth bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter waters. Though the Righteouſneſs of God do ſerve to <hi>give vent</hi> to godly ſorrow, yet it is the goodneſs and holineſs of God that <hi>gives it.</hi> Do we ſorrow for ſin, becauſe it ſpoiled us of our comforts, ſtript us of our ornaments? Then ſure we think there is ſomething in the world worſe than ſin, for which we ſhould bewail it, and hate it; and ſo conſequently, that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than God, for which we ſhould love him. Alas, how apt are we to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100587:42"/> run into a practical blaſphemy before we be aware! In a word then to decide this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, Our afflictions, loſſes, diſtreſſes in the world, may poſſibly be as a <hi>Bucket</hi> to draw up this water of godly ſorrow; but they muſt not be the Ciſtern to <hi>receive and hold it.</hi> Serious and ſpiritual Humiliation is a real converſing with the Righteouſneſs of God. To <hi>meet</hi> God, is indeed to <hi>fall down before him;</hi> and to converſe with him, is to lie down under him. The truth of which temper is beſt evidenced by that excellent Commentator, the Life of a Chriſtian: This doth beſt declare the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and interpret the meaning of heart-Humiliation. He that breaks off his ſins, doth beſt make it appear that his heart is broken for them.

            <p>3. <hi>Converſe with the Faithfulneſs of God.</hi> This attribute of God hath reſpect to his promiſes; and therefore it may be you will think ſtrange that I ſhould ſpeak of this in a diſcourſe of afflictions, as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving place there at all. Every one will readily acknowledge that Gods Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Righteouſneſs do clearly appear in his Judgments; but how his Faithfulneſs can be exerciſed therein, they ſee not. What, faithful in puniſhing, in plaguing, in viſiting, in afflicting, diſtreſſing his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how can that be? Many will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to think rather, that God is not faithful at ſuch a time, when he denyes what he had promiſed to give, takes away what he had promiſed to continue; when he plagues <hi>David</hi> every morning, when he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him that the <hi>Plague ſhould not come nigh his dwelling;</hi> when he brings <hi>Abijah</hi> to the grave, whom he had promiſed, that his dayes ſhould be <hi>long upon the Land;</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> to the dunghill, to whom all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were made both of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. Is this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs? Doth God fulfil his promiſes by fruſtrating them? Notwithſtanding all this, it ſeems that the faithfulneſs of God hath place in the afflictions of his people:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100587:44"/> For ſo ſaith <hi>David</hi> expreſly, <hi>Pſal. 119.75. I know that in faithfulneſs thou haſt afflicted me:</hi> if indeed faithfulneſs be taken proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that place: Neither indeed need it ſeem ſo ſtrange as ſome men make it; for God hath promiſed his covenant-people, to viſit their iniquity with a Rod, <hi>Pſal. 89. 32. The Rod The Rod of a man;</hi> a fatherly chaſtiſement, as it is explained, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 14. where this ſeems to be made a branch of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and is underſtood by many as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. But if that be not a plain promiſe, I am ſure there is one in <hi>Pſal. 84. 11. No good thing will he with hold from them that walk uprightly:</hi> And if no good thing, then no correction neither; for that is often good and profitable for the people of God in this world for many excellent ends; which (conſidering the nature of man) cannot well be accompliſhed without it; as might appear in many particulars; but it is not needful to run out into them. God will take more care of his own people, than of the reſt of the world; and will rather correct them, than not reduce them. It is their main bappineſs that he takes care for, and he will in kindneſs take out of the way whatever hinders it, and give whatever may promote it. Gods thoughts are not as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100587:44"/> our thoughts: he judges otherwiſe of health, riches, liberty, friends, &amp;c. than we do, We are apt to meaſure God by ourſelves, and our own affections, which is the ground of our miſtake in this buſineſs. We mind the things that pleaſe our fleſh, our ſenſes, our appetite, our fancy; but God minds the things that concern our ſouls, and their true happineſs. The Saints are much dearer to God, and much more beloved of him, than they are to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and therefore he will not give them what's ſweet, but what's meet; he will give them what makes for their real and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs, whether they would have it or no. He loves them with a ſtrong and powerful love, and will not deny them any thing that is truly good for them, though they <hi>cry out under it;</hi> nor allow them any thing that is really hurtful, though they <hi>cry after it.</hi> So will a wiſe Father upon Earth do by his children, to the beſt of his skill and power; much more will God then, <hi>qui pluſquam patrium amorem gerit in ſuos,</hi> whoſe bowels are infinitely larger and ſtronger than thoſe of a Father. Now then, labour to converſe with the Faithfulneſs of God in the time of afflictions, which is by ſtudying the Covenant and the promiſes of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100587:45"/> it, and your preſent condition, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them together, and obſerving how conſonant and agreeable they are, each interpreting other. As alſo by perſwading your hearts of the conſiſtency of afflictions with divine love and favour; and by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying to reconcile the hand and heart of God together. But eſpecially converſe with it practically, by a holy <hi>eſtabliſhment</hi> and ſettlement of heart under all afflictions. For, whereas afflictions in themſelves are apt to beget a fearfulneſs, deſpondency, or at leaſt fluctuation in the ſoul, the lively ſenſe of Gods Faithfulneſs in inflicting them, will ſettle and ſuſtain it: It is a firm and conſiſtent thing, upon which the ſhaking ſoul may ſettle ſafely, and center it ſelf boldly.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Converſe with the Holineſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Purity of God.</hi> He is angry, and ſins not; he corects for ſin, without ſin. <hi>Fury is not in me, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 27. 4. There is no paſſionate malicious temper in the pure and holy God; no revengeful appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to feed upon the blood of his creature. He is of purer eyes than to behold the leaſt iniquity; and of a purer nature, than any way to miſcarry in any of his dealings or diſpenſations. Converſe then with this
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100587:45"/> Infinite Holineſs of God: Keep up pure, equitable, honourable thoughts of him in your hearts. Take heed of fancying to your ſelves a God guilty of paſſion of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, or carryed away with ſuch weak and mixed affections as we our ſelves are. But more practically, converſe with Gods Holineſs in the time of afflictions, by laying even little ſins greatly to heart: little ſins, compared with Infinite Holineſs and Purity, ought to be matter of great and ſerious ſorrow to a ſenſible ſoul. Again, take heed of the leaſt miſcarriages under affliction, of departing from God in the leaſt. This I know is the great duty and care of every tender-hearted Chriſtian at all times. But I conceive we ought more eſpecially to preſs it upon our hearts in the time of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, becauſe we are then moſt apt to indulge ſome kind of humane paſſions, which we call natural affections; as if we had a licenſe to care and fear, and grieve, and complain, not only in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but even in an irregular manner. Oh let the ſenſe of Gods Infinite Purity, and perefect Holineſs, check and awe thoſe very natural affections, be they what they will, if they offer to exceed their bounds, and overflow their banks. But this I
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100587:46"/> toucht upon before under another head, amongſt the Reaſons of the Doctrine. Therefore</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Converſe with the Almighty Power of God.</hi> That God is Infinite and Almighty in Power, I need not undertake to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. No man had read a leaf in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor indeed turned over one leaf in the book of the creatures, that hath not learnt this. I need not ſure turn you to any particular mighty work of God: They that inſtance in his letting looſe the virtues of the creatures, in the caſe of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal deluge, or binding up of their influences, as in the caſe of the three captive Jews, <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Jonah,</hi> when he kept the fire from burning, and forbade the Lions to eat one, and the fiſh to digeſt another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet whom he had eaten, do make but a poor gueſs at Almightineſs, but a faint eſſay to deſcribe it. The Creation of the leaſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of nothing, is an higher argument of Divine Power, than the command of the greateſt that is already created. Eye God duly in the notion of a Creator; yea, of a Creator of your own ſouls and bodies, and you have enough to fill you with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting admiration, as <hi>David</hi> was filled, <hi>Pſal. 139. 14. I am fearfully and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100587:46"/> made.</hi> But it is not enough to eye or acknowledge, or admire; we muſt yet do more, if we will rightly converſe with the Almightineſs of God, <hi>viz.</hi> by the acts of <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Dependence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Reverence that Almighty and glorious God in your hearts,</hi> who can bring <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet,</hi> any thing out of any thing; yea, out of nothing; yea, any thing to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in a moment. Reverence that power of God, that can pour contempt upon Princes; that can bring <hi>Job</hi> the greateſt of all the men of the Eaſt, to lye in the Aſhes, and make his Bed in the Dunghill; that can ſend home <hi>Naomi</hi> empty, who went out full and flouriſhing. Hath he done ſo by you, debaſed you when you were high, tumbled you down from the clouds, and rowled you in the duſt, emptied you when you were full, withered you when you were freſh and flouriſhing? Let not God loſe the glory of his Almighty Power; reverence that glorious hand of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Reſt upon the ſame Almighty God, who can alſo bring up the ſame <hi>Job</hi> from the dunghill, and ſet him with Princes, and fill empty <hi>Naomi</hi> with a famous off ſpring, throwing into her lap one of the Anceſtors of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> according to the fleſh. The
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100587:47"/> ſame Power that cauſed your Sun to go down at midday, when you leaſt <hi>ſuſpected,</hi> can alſo cauſe it to riſe at midnight, when you leaſt <hi>hope.</hi> Dwell not upon creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probabilities, or improbabilities: but lift up thy ſelf believing ſoul, and be aſſured, that God can do what he will, and he will do what is good for them that love him, according to the dictates of unſearchable wiſdom and goodneſs. Thou that art rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the duſt, yet ariſe and roll thy ſelf upon thoſe Almighty Arms that brought thee thither, and are able to advance thee: As I have ſeen a child thrown by his Father off, and thrown down to the ground in a ſeeming diſpleaſure, yet clinging to the ſame hand, and will not let it go, till at length he riſe up again by it: a fit emblem of a child of God, whom his heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeems as if he had caſt off. The wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand of God is apt to amaze indeed, and to beget conſternation and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But remember, the ſame hand that wounds, can alſo heal; he that breaks us, can alſo make up all our breaches: let this beget confidence and dependence. God never wounds deeper, than that he can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily bind up the wound again; never throws his people ſo low, as that they ſhould be
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100587:47"/> out of his reach, Take heed therefore of unſeemly deſpondencies; caſt not away your confidence, which ſhall have a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, if ye maintain it: A recompence I ſay; for that God that can recover the ſetting Sun, and exalt it in its beauty and brightneſs, and doth ſo every morning; that can cloath the forlorn and naked trees with leaves, and fruits; that can recoves the verdure of the withering graſs, and doth ſo every year; he can alſo cauſe light to ariſe to them that ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 2.</p>
            <p>He that could give unto <hi>Amaziah</hi> much more than that which he parted with at his command, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. 9. that could turn again the captivity of <hi>Job,</hi> and give him double for what he had taken from him, <hi>Job ult.</hi> 10. he can ſurely make his people <hi>glad according to the dayes wherein he hath afflicted them, and the years whenein they have ſeen evil,</hi> Pſal. 90. 15.

Why did I not alſo undertake to appoint him the time and place of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born? Shall I ſay it is too much, when Infinite Wiſdome thinks it is not enough? Ceaſe wrangling, ſoul, and be at reſt, for the Lord deals wiſely with thee. Such a ſoul ſo converſing with the all-wiſe God, dare freely refer all to him, venture all with him; if he ſmite him on <hi>the one cheek,</hi> he dare <hi>turn to him the other;</hi> if he take away his Coat, he dare offer him his Cloak alſo; if he take away his liberty, he dare truſt him with his life too; if he ſmite him in ſome of his comforts, he dare turn to him the reſt alſo; for he knows that Infinite Wiſdom cannot erre in Judgment, nor miſcarry in his diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>God knoweth when, and how beſt to deliver us.</hi> This neceſſarily follows upon the former. To him all times,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100587:54"/> and all things paſt, preſent, and to come, are equally preſent: In one ſingle act of underſtanding, he doth wonderfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend both cauſes and events, ſickneſſes and cures, afflictions and deliverances. Let the Atheiſtical world cry, Theſe are they that are forſaken, whom no man careth for; there is no hope for them in their God, as their manner is to blaſpheme. Still the promiſe ſtands unrepealed in both Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments, I will never leave you, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake you: though the caſe be never ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme and deſperate, ſtill the Apoſtles word holds good, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temprations. If all paſſages be blockt up, he will rather make a gap in the Sea, than his people ſhall not eſcape, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. And this way and time of Gods delivering, is the moſt excellent, ſuitable, and certain, as might abundantly appear in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: But that would be a digreſſion. In the general, be aſſured that Gods way is the beſt way of deliverance, and his time is alſo the beſt time. He that ſits as a <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>finer of Silver,</hi> knows how, and when to take out the metal, that it be purified, and not hurt. Here I might enter into a large diſcourſe, and ſhew you how the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100587:55"/> judgment of man is ordinarily deceived, and his expectations diſappointed, which he had built upon creature-probabilities, when in the mean time the purpoſe of God takes place in a far better and more comfortable deliverance of his ſervants. But it may ſuffice to have hinted it only.</p>
            <p>Our duty is to converſe with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Divine Wiſdom by the exerciſes of <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Hope.</hi> If God ſeem to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long, yet wait patiently for his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for he will appear in the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable time, and <hi>in the end ye ſhall conſider it,</hi> and acknowledge it. Take heed of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as that murmuring generation did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 41. Take heed of fixing of your deliverance to ſuch or ſuch a train and ſeries of cauſes which you have layd in your own heads, and of engaging God to act by your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: If God be a wiſe Agent, its fit he ſhould be a free Agent too. Bear up Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſoul, faint not when thou art rebuked of him; <hi>Caſt thy burden upon the Lord,</hi> and he will in due time, find out a way either of leſſening it, or removing it. <hi>You have heard of the patience of</hi> Job, <hi>and you have ſeen the end of the Lord,</hi> James 5. 11. Be you patient, and you ſhall ſee it too; a better
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100587:55"/> end than ever you could have accompliſht by your own act or induſtry. In the mean time, cheriſh in your hearts a lively hope of an happy iſſue: For your lives and comforts are all hid in him, in whom alſo are bid all the treaſures of wildom and knowledge. As the conſideration of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom, in knowing how, and when beſt to deliver us, may ſettle our hearts that they do not riſe up as a ſoam upon the waters through impatience; ſo it may bear up our hearts, that they do not ſink within us, as a ſtone in the waters, through deſperation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>God knoweth how to make the beſt uſe of all for our good.</hi> I ſay, of all, both of the affliction, the manner and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it, of his delay, and of the ſeaſon which he chuſes to redeem us in. He can make <hi>Paul's</hi> impriſonment turn to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, <hi>Phil. 1. 19. Job's</hi> captivity to redound to his far greater ſtate, <hi>Job ult. Joſeph's</hi> baniſhment, to make him great; and <hi>Manaſſeh's,</hi> to make him good. This is a large Theme, and therefore I dare not rifle into it particularly. Take all in one word from-the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 8. 28. All things do work together for good to them that love God.</hi> Whatever the promiſes be, the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100587:56"/> only wiſe God knows how to draw a happy concluſion from them. G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed in your hearts, and converſe with the Wiſdom of God in this Inſtance of it by the great Grace of <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſignation.</hi> The Soveraignty of God may well work us into a reſignation of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and comforts, and concernments to him: But this Infinite Wiſdom of God ought in reaſon to work us into a reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion even of our very wills unto him. Oh this debaſing of ſelf-will, this ſelf-reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a noble and ingenuous act of a pious ſoul (for ſo I dare call him in whom it is found) whereby it honours God greatly in all that comes upon it. A godly ſoul, conſidering it ſelf ignorant of many things, burdened with many corruptions, and clogg'd with an animal body, ſenſes, appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, fancy, which are alwayes calling for things inconvenient, if not unlawful, doth conclude it would not be good for it to be at its own finding, or caring, or carving: and duly eying that infinite mind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, who in a wonderful, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable manner, orders all things, and all events to the beſt and certain iſſue, is ſo maſtered by, and indeed enamoured with the ſenſe of it, that he renounces his

               </gap>ll, and complyes readily with the all-wiſe God. This is truly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the Wiſdom of God, when we do out of choice refer our ſelves to it, and rowl our ſelves upon it. Every bare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of Divine Wiſdom is not a proper converſing with it; but when the ſame is wrought into the ſoul, and the lively ſenſe of it doth ſo over-power the heart, that the will is prepared to cloſe readily with ſuch Methods as God ſhall pleaſe to uſe to accompliſh his own ends; then do we properly, and feeling<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y converſe with God, under the notion of the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe God. But this of Self-reſignation I ſpoke ſomething to under the firſt head; and much of that which is ſpoken there, may be indifferently applyed hither. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
            <p>7. Converſe with the unbounded <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Love, and Mercy of God.</hi> God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely and unchangeably loving and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to his people: he is <hi>good,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt; and he is <hi>Love,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 8. Thoſe dreadful and terrifying apprehenſions which men have of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and good God, as if he were ſome au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere and ſurly Majeſty, given to paſſion
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100587:57"/> and revenge, are apt to deſtroy that chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ingenuous converſe with him, which the creature ſhould maintain with its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor at all times: But then are we moſt prone to entertain thoſe apprehenſions, and to harbour ſuch unſeemly notions of him, when he appears in the way of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when we take a view of him in the ruines of our comforts, the blood of our friends, the ſpoyl of our goods, and in the diſtreſſes of our lives. We are apt to frame notions of God according to what we find in our own diſpoſition, to fancy a God like unto our ſelves; and therefore we cannot eye an afflicting God, but we preſently conclude an angry God; as though the Eternal and Pure Being, were ſubject to paſſions and changes, as we are. Theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions being once drunk into the ſoul, it becomes unhinged preſently, and almoſt afraid to behold the face of love it ſelf, but flyes and hides it ſelf, as <hi>Adam</hi> in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: or if the ſoul do converſe with God at all, it is as a City that is beſieged conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with the enemy without, <hi>viz.</hi> ſending out to ſeek peace, and to obtain a ceſſation of Arms. And ſo a ſoul may beſtow much upon God, ſurrender up the Caſtle, give him all that he hath almoſt, not for any
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100587:57"/> love that he bears to him; but as <hi>Joaſh</hi> gave <hi>Hazael</hi> a preſent of gold and precious things, to hire him to depart from him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 18. Oh then they will on and do any thing; yea, circumciſe their lives, as <hi>Zipporah</hi> circumciſed her Son, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4 25. to eſcape the hands of an angry God. Every one will converſe with God as an enemy in time of extremity; hang out a flag ſor peace, ſend preſents, pay a homage, ſend Embaſſadors to entreat his face: But few know how to converſe with the Goodneſs and Mercy of God, with him as their dear and only friend in a time of affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Many cannot believe the Mercy and Kindneſs of God, when he is in the way of his Judgments.</hi> If it be ſo, why am I thus? cryes the poor ſoul, ſtrugling under its burden, and travelling in pangs to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of its griefs. Thus unbelievingly argues <hi>Gideon</hi> (who was otherwiſe famous for ſaith) in the time of his bitter bondage under the Midianites, <hi>Judg.</hi> 6. 13. when an Angel from Heaven was ſent to aſſure

               </gap>ken us; for he hath delivered us into the hands of the <hi>Midianites.</hi> The ſad ſoul is ready to cry concerning Chriſts gracious preſence, as the two Siſters concerning his perſonal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>John 11. 21, 32. Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my Brother had not dyed:</hi> Lord, if thou hadſt been here, if thou hadſt loved me, if thou hadſt had any delight in me, my Brother had not dyed, my Husband, my Wife, my Children had not dyed; I had not been thus plagued, afflicted, wounded, tormented as I am. Hence we have thoſe many complaints of the afflicted ſoul, up and down the Pſalms; <hi>Hath the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to be gracious? Is his Mercy clean gone? Hath he ſhut up his tender Mercies in anger?</hi> and many ſuch like. The ſmart of our ſenſes, is apt to pervert the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our minds; and the ſenſe of bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evils, is ready to deſtroy all ſenſe of the Infinite and Unchangeable Goodneſs and Love of God. Now this great evil ſeems to ariſe from theſe two cauſes, <hi>viz. our
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100587:58"/> meaſuring of God and his Divine Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by our ſelves and humane paſſions and affections,</hi> as I hinted before: And <hi>our meaſuring the Love of God too much by the proportion that he gives us of worldly proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> Woe to him in a day of diſtreſs, that was wont to judge of Divine Love by the things that are <hi>before him,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> calls the things of this world, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9 1. This, I ſay, is the temper, the infirmity of many in the time of afflictions: though indeed there be no reaſon for it. For why ſhould we conclude harſhly concerning <hi>Job</hi> upon the dunghill, any more than we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude charitably concerning <hi>Ahab</hi> on the Throne? Beſides, the Scripture teache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h expreſly, that the Love of God doth ſtand with correction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 33. I will viſit his iniquity, but my loving kindneſs w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Others do indeed believe the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mercy of God to them in a time of affliction, <hi>but either they cannot, or dare not, or will not converſe with it, nor take comfort in it.</hi> They remember God with
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100587:59"/> the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal. 77. 3. i. e.</hi> the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Bounty, Mercy of God (ſaith <hi>Molle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi>) and yet at the ſame time are <hi>troubled;</hi> their hearts are unquiet, fluctuating, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous within them. The ſoul is ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt with the ſenſe of ſin which it hath contracted from the conſideration of its ſufferings, that it dare not preſume to meddle with Mercy; but though this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God be its own, yet is ready to think that it is a duty <hi>to forſake its own Mercies,</hi> as though it heard God chiding it in the words of <hi>Jehu</hi> to <hi>Jorams</hi> ſcout, 2 <hi>King. 9. 18. What haſt thou to do with peace?</hi> What haſt thou to do with Mercy? <hi>turn ye behind me.</hi> An afflicted ſoul hath much adoe to believe it to be a duty to converſe with the Goodneſs and Love of God in a time of affliction. It eaſily agrees to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the Juſtice, Holineſs, and Power of God indeed; but thinks it very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and unſeaſonable, if not unſafe, to converſe with his Mercy. It is ready to cry with <hi>Solomon</hi> preſently, <hi>In the day of proſperity rejoyce, but in the day of adverſity conſider:</hi> or with the Apoſtle, <hi>If any be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, let him pray;</hi> if he be merry, let him ſing Pſalms. Converſing with the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God ſeems not to be a duty of this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100587:59"/> ſeaſon. I confeſs this is a high and hard duty. Every ſmatterer in Religion will cry out in his affliction, Thou art juſt and righteous, O Lord: But, Thou art good and merciſul: Bleſſed be the name of the Lord, is the voice of a <hi>Job</hi> only, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 21. But it is a duty, though a hard one; and affording much pleaſure and contentment to them that are exerciſed therein. That the kindneſs and benignity of God doth not fail, that his Love is not broken off from his people; no, nor ſuſpended neither, when he afflicts them moſt, is moſt certain. For, though he worketh changes, in and upon us, yet himſelf is eternally and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably the ſame, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 17. And, though ſome of his dealings towards his people ſeem to be rough and ſevere, yet if we judge rightly of them, they are all Mercy and Truth towards them that keep his Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 10. And that the people of God ought to converſe with this Divine Love and Mercy even in their greateſt afflictions, is as clear: To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I might alledge the forequoted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of holy <hi>Job;</hi> and might enforce this Doctrine from the Apoſtles words, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 4. and <hi>Jam. 1. 2. Count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</hi> and from
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100587:60"/> many good Reaſons too, if it were needful. I know indeed that it is a hard thing to keep up a right frame towards, and converſe rightly with the Righteouſneſs, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God at the ſame time; the one frame is ready to juſtle out the other. Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is apt to contract the heart, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the large and chearful temper of it: And joy doth dilate and enlarge it, and is ready to make it forget its grief: But, though it be hard, yet it is poſſible: Theſe two may well conſiſt in the ſame ſoul, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that in <hi>Pſal 2. 11.—Rejoyce with trembling.</hi>

               </gap>e Sun of Righteouſneſs warm us, though it do not dazle us; and though we cannot perceive it to ſhine upon us, yet we find it to ſhine in us.

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodneſs, when we are really warmed with it; and with Almighty Love, when we rejoyce in it, and can with holy ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs, and humble confidence, throw our ſelves into the very boſome of it:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100587:61"/> when we receive impreſſions of it from the Spirit of God, and are thereby molded into a temper fuitable to it, and becoming it. For then indeed do we moſt happily converſe with the Love and Goodneſs of God, when we for our part do live upon it; when we being aſſured of an intereſt in a loving and good God, do render up our ſelves alſo unto him, in the moſt beautiful and becoming affections of Love, Joy, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and holy Delight. This is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent frame; and, ſure I am, it is much for our intereſt, thus to converſe with God in the time of our afflictions. It is a high way of glorifying God, and bringing much credit to Religion: And indeed he that keeps up this frame, can be afflicted but in part; he ſcapes the greater half of the evil: For though it be never ſo ſtormy a time without him, a ſtorm upon his houſe, upon his goods, upon his relations, yea upon his own body; yet it is a calm day within; in the ſoul there is peace and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>Laſtly (and indeed everlaſtingly too) we are to converſe with the Infinite, <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient Fulneſs of God</hi> in a day of the greateſt extremity: that is, as if I ſhould ſay, not with any one ſingle Attribute, but
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100587:61"/> with the very godhead of God, the immenſe perfection of God, the Allneſs of the Deity. Oh how ſeaſonably doth this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed object preſent its ſelf to the ſoul in a time of afflictions, loſſes, mortalities, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, when we are moſt emptied of creature-enjoyments, and the emptineſs of them doth moſt appear! for upon theſe two doth our converſing with God much depend. I need not tell you how apt we are to live beſide God, when we have our fill of creature-delights; whilſt we can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain our hearts with a created ſweetneſs, we ſooliſhly forget and neglect the ſupreme good. And ſo fond and unreaſonable is this affection, that no warnings, no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts will ſerve the turn; God is forced to break that off from us, from which we would not be broken. Sure I am, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and bountiful God envyes not his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants any of their creature-comforts or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; but he loves them (as I ſaid before) with a ſtrong and powerful love, and will not ſuffer them to live ſo much to their loſſes, as they do, when they ſpend noble affections upon tranſitory things, in the everlaſting enjoyment of which they could never be happy.

            <p>Now then in ſuch a caſe, at ſuch a time, converſe with the Infinite, ſelf-ſufficient Fulneſs of God. Oh now it is ſeaſonable; now it is your duty; nay now it will be your greateſt policy! If that chanel, that creature-chanel be ſtopt, in which your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were wont to run too freely; turn the ſtream of them into their proper cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel in which they may run freely, and neither ever meet with obſtruction, nor ever overflow. Let your ſoul grow up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to acquaintance and union with God by creature-breaches and diſappointments. More particularly, converſe with the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient Fulneſs of God,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the act of <hi>Creature-denyal.</hi> The eying of an infinite, abſolute, uncreated
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100587:63"/> Fulneſs in a right manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> takes off the ſoul from all created objects, earthly things: even as the beholding of the Sun in its glory, dazles the eye to all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. God becomes ſo great in the eye of the ſoul, that it cannot ſee the poor motes of worldly comforts. Give a ſoul a feeling taſte of the infinite ſweetneſs and fulneſs of the fountain, and its thirſt after the poor puddles of the world is preſently abated, if not perfectly quenched; according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Joh. 4. 14. Whoſoever ſhall drink of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt;</hi> that is, not after any other thing. Like unto which is that Goſpel promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 10. they ſhall not thirſt, who do enjoy theſe ſprings of water. When this fountain is opened in the eye of the ſoul, and the ſoul begins to taſte of it, it longs to drink deeper of that indeed; but as for all other waters, waters of the Ciſtern, the ſoul looks upon them as not being, or at leaſt as being bitter, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Marah</hi> in compariſon; we do then truly converſe with the infinite, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient Fulneſs of God, when we look upon all created good with a noble diſdain, are content to part with it; or if we do ſtill enjoy it, are reſolved to enjoy it only

               </gap>her of Lights; as a drop of the infinite Fountain of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Tell me, Is it not a poor and low thing that many Profeſſors do, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and magnifie the uncreated Goodneſs, the Fulneſs of God; and yet at the ſame time do covet and court the creature with all eagerneſs; and their worldlineſs is apparently too hard for their Religion? Methinks I hear God ſpeaking to ſuch ſeeming friends, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilah</hi> to <hi>Sampſon, Judg.</hi> 16. 15. How can ye ſay, you love me, when your heart is not with me? To theſe mens hearts, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks our Saviours Doctrine ſhould ſtrike cold, <hi>Mat. 6. 21. Where your treaſure is, there will your heart be alſo:</hi> And thoſe words of his beloved Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 15. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> Let a man pretend and profeſs what he will; and in words magnifie the Fulneſs and Sufficiency of God as much as he will; if in the mean time his ſoul be bound up in the creature, ſuch a mans Religion is vain: nay, indeed his profeſſion of God becomes a real reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, and a blaſphemy againſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſelf. Let your low eſtem of all

For, however men may make a ſhift to cheat themſelves, God is not truly great in the ſoul, till all other things become as nothing; neither doth the ſoul rightly converſe with his Infinite Fulneſs, ſo long as any thing ſtands in oppoſition to it, or competition with it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Converſe with the ſelf-ſufficient Fulneſs of God by the grace of <hi>Faith:</hi> I mean by that act of it, whereby we do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt our ſelves, and as it were wrap up our own ſouls in this Fulneſs, and make it our own. And herein there is no danger of a humble ſouls being too bold or ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: For the Proclamation is full, and the Invitation free, <hi>Iſa. 55. 1. Joh. 7. 37.

And indeed we cannot truly and comfortably converſe with the Infinite Perfection and Fulneſs of God, if we have no title to it: but then we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God, when we converſe with our own God, not anothers: when the ſoul is able to ſay; All this Fulneſs of Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, is all mine in my head Chriſt Jeſus; for in him <hi>all</hi> this <hi>Fulneſs dwels,</hi> Col. 2. 9. and he dwelleth in me; <hi>in him are hid</hi> all theſe treaſures, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. and <hi>my life alſo is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> as theirs was in <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3. You ſee then, that a ſoul cannot converſe with the Infinite Fulneſs and Self-ſufficiency of God, but by Chriſt; for it is in and by him that we receive of Divine Fulneſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16. Hence was that of the devout Father, <hi>Tolle meum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tolle Deum;</hi> to which I may add, <hi>Tolle Jeſum, &amp; tollis meum.</hi> The fulneſs of a fountain is nothing to me, except it be mine. There is bread enough in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, ſayes the poor Prodigal, but for all that I periſh with hunger: ſo is there living waters evermore in this uncreated life, this infinite Spring of all Perfection; yet many ſouls are choakt with thirſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100587:65"/> the fountain is not theirs; it is a fountain ſealed, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe; <hi>The Well is deep,</hi> and they have <hi>nothing to draw with,</hi> as the Woman ſaid concerning another Well, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. Therefore be ſure you get an intereſt in the Fulneſs and Sufficiency of God; or as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks in another caſe (<hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 15.) Drink waters out of thine own Well.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Converſe with the Self-ſufficient Fulneſs of God, by delighting your ſelves in it. Drink of this Fountain, yea <hi>drink abundantly</hi> ye <hi>beloved</hi> of God, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 1. yea, lie down by it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 2. yea bathe you ſelves wholly in it; <hi>Enter into the Joy of your Lord,</hi> lie down in his boſome, ſpread your ſelves in his Love and Fulneſs. The Beloved Diſciple leaning upon the breaſt of his Lord at Supper, was but a dark ſhadow, a poor ſcant reſemblance of a beloved ſoul, which by the lovely acts of Joy and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Delight, layes it ſelf down in the boſome of Jeſus, and doth not feed with him, but feed upon him, and his Alſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency. Then do we converſe indeed feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and comfortably with the Infinite Fulneſs, when the ſoul is ſwallowed up in it, doth reſt in it, is filled with it, and centred upon it. Oh the noble and free-born ſpirit
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100587:65"/> of true Religion, that diſdaining the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of low and created things, is carryed out with delight to feed, and dwell, and live upon uncreated Fulneſs! Then is a ſoul raiſed to its juſt altitude, to the very height of its Being, when it can ſpend all its powers upon the ſupreme and ſelf-ſufficient good, ſpreading and ſtretching it ſelf upon God with full contentment, and wrapping up it ſelf entirely in him. This is the ſouls way of living above loſſes; and he that ſo lives, though he may often be a <hi>loſer,</hi> yet ſhall never be <hi>at a loſs.</hi> He who feeds upon created Goodneſs or Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may ſoon eat himſelf out of all; the ſtock will be ſpent, and (which is worſe) the ſoul will be <hi>dryed up,</hi> that hath nothing elſe to nouriſh it. But he that lives upon uncreated Fulneſs, is never at a loſs, though he loſe never ſo much of the creature: For who will value the ſpilling of a diſh of water, that hath a well of living water at his door, from whence he had that, and can have more as good, though not the ſame. Nay, to ſpeak properly, this is the only way to loſe nothing. For how can he be properly ſaid to loſe any thing, who poſſeſſes all things? And ſo doth
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100587:66" rendition="simple:additions"/> he, I am ſure, who is filled with the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God. Be ſure therefore, that in the want, in the loſs of all things, you live upon the Fountain-fulneſs, delight your ſelf in the Lord, after the example of the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk, cap.</hi> 3. 17, 18.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE holy Apoſtle having in the firſt verſe of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter layd down the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Eternal Glory, which ſhall follow upon this tranſitory life of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, ſhews in the following verſes how he himſelf longed within himſelf, and groaned after that happy ſtate: And then
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100587:67"/> Proceeds to give a double ground of this his confident expectation; one in <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. therefore is the Apoſtle confident concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the putting off of this mortal body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had wrought and formed him for this ſtate of glory, and already given him an <hi>earneſt</hi> of it, even his holy Spirit: The other ground of the confidence and ſettledneſs of his mind as to his deſires of a change, is taken from his preſent ſtate in the body, which was but poor and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable in compariſon of that glorious ſtate: This in the words of the Text, <hi>Therefore we are alwayes confident, knowing that whilſt we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord.</hi> For I do not take the words [we are confident] concerning the Apoſtles reſolvedneſs with a quiet and ſober mind to ſuffer any kind of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or affliction whatever; but <hi>we are alwayes confident, i. e.</hi> we do with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence expect, or at leaſt we are alwayes well ſatisfied, contented, well reſolved in our minds concerning our departure out of this life: For the Apoſtle was ſpeaking, not of afflictions or perſecutions in the former verſes, but indeed of death; which he calls a diſſolving of the earthly houſe of this tabernacle, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. and a being
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100587:67"/> cloathed upon with our houſe which is from Heaven, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. 4. Yea and thus the Apoſtle explains himſelf, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. where he tells you what he means by this his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>we are confident and willing rather to be abſent from the body;</hi> where the latter words are exegetical to the former, <hi>q. d.</hi> It is better to be with the Lord, than in this mortal body; but we cannot be with the Lord whilſt we are in this body; it keeps us from him, therefore we have the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to part with it. It is the reaſon of the Apoſtles confidence and willingneſs to part with the body, that I am to ſpeak of; and the reaſon is, becauſe this body keeps him from his Lord,—<hi>whilſt we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord.</hi> The words are a Metaphor, and are to be tranſlated thus, <hi>we indwelling in the body, do dwell out from the Lord;</hi> which our Tranſlation renders well, taking little notice of the Metaphor, <hi>whilſt we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord.</hi> Though indeed if they had left out that word [<hi>at home</hi>] it would have been as well, and ſo have neglected the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor altogether, as we may haply hint hereafter. The words are a reaſon of the Apoſtles willingneſs to be diſſolved, and do
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100587:68"/> contain a kind of an accuſat on of the body, and ſo ſeem to lay a blame upon it, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this animal life; which muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. Now for the former phraſe of being at home in the body, it is eaſily underſtood, and generally (I think) agreed upon, to be no more than whilſt we carry about with us this corruptible fleſh, whilſt we live this na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and doth not at all allude to his ſinful, unregenerate or carnal ſtate. But the latter phraſe [<hi>Abſent from the Lord</hi>] is capable of a double ſenſe, both good and true; and I think both fit enough to the context and drift of the Apoſtle. I ſhall ſpeak to both, but inſiſt moſt upon the latter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whilſt we are in the body, we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Lord, <hi>i. e. from the bodily preſence of the Lord in Heaven,</hi> abſent from Chriſt Jeſus and his glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſo the words are the ſame in ſenſe with 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 50. Fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God:</hi> for by <hi>fleſh and blood</hi> there, muſt needs be meant man in this animal corruptible ſtate. And ſo the Apoſtle accuſes this kind of life in the body, and, as it were, blames it for ſtanding between
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100587:68"/> him and his glorified Lord; and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently between him and the glory of his Lord. And this ſenſe doth well agree with what went before, and with what follows. The Apoſtle hath a great mind to depart; for whilſt he is in the body, he is abſent from his perfect happineſs: For this is the conſummation of a Chriſtians happineſs, to be with the Lord, to be admitted to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of his infinite glory; as appears by our Saviours earneſt prayer for this, <hi>Joh. 17. 24. Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory.</hi> Beſides, if we ſhall ſee him as he is, we muſt alſo needs be made l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now we are kept from this ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and beholding of the Lord in glory, by this animal life: It ſtands between us and the Crown, between us and our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Joy, between us and the perfect en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God. To be with the Lord, is a ſtate of perfect freedom from ſin. No unclean thing ſhall, or can enter into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. A perfect freedom from all manner of affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, all tears ſhall be

This is the happy ſtate of ſeeing God, of being with the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. Whilſt we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord, without any reference to the world to come; and ſo it may be fitly tranſlated <hi>diſtant</hi> from the Lord, eſtranged from God: This agrees well with the context, and ſcope of the Apoſtle alſo. And thus the words are alſo a good ground of the Apoſtles reſolution and willingneſs to dye, <hi>q. d.</hi> I am willing to be abſent from this body; for whilſt I am in it, I find my ſelf to be at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

               </gap> ſignifies properly <hi>to be at a diſtance,</hi> or to be eſtranged: So I find it interpreted by a learned Critick, without any myſtery, (as he ſpeaks) of the diſtance that even Believers themſelves ſtand at from God in this life. And in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s ſenſe I ſhall chuſe to proſecute the words. In which ſenſe the Apoſtle blames this body and animal life, becauſe it keeps us at a diſtance from God; is a clog, a ſnare, a fetter, a pinion to the ſoul. And ſo the words do agree in ſenſe with thoſe of our Saviour, <hi>Mat. 26. 41. The ſpirit is willing, but the fleſh is weak;</hi> where by the [<hi>fleſh</hi>] muſt needs be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the body, if we conſider the contex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, <hi>viz.</hi> the occaſion upon which the words were ſpoken, the ſleepineſs of the Apoſtles; or if we conſider the propriety of ſpeech according to the ſtyle of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: True indeed, the corruption of nature is ſometimes called <hi>Fleſh;</hi> but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that way of ſpeaking, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour would rather have ſaid, That the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was willing, but the fleſh was ſtrong; as he ſaith elſewhere, That the <hi>ſtrong man</hi> armed kept the houſe. Now to explain this Doctrine a little; <hi>That even the godly themſelves, whilſt they are in this body, are
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100587:70"/> at a diſtance from the Lord:</hi> It muſt be granted, that the godly ſoul is nigh unto God, even whilſt it ſo journs in this mortal body, and tottering fleſh. All ſouls are involved in the Apoſtaſie of <hi>Adam,</hi> and are fallen down from God, have alike ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this, though it be a priviledge, yet it is not that honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able priviledge of the truly godly ſouls, who are by Chriſt Jeſus raiſed up to God in their hearts, and reconciled to him in their natures, and united to him in their affections; and ſo are made nigh unto him in a more eſpecial and ſpiritual manner. Thus all ſinful and wicked ſouls, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their profeſſion and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, are far from God, eſtranged from the life of God. Enmity and diſſimilitude are the moſt real diſtance from God: And truly God-like ſouls only are nigh unto him; they dwell in him, and he dwelleth in them as in his moſt proper Temple. As to any kind of Appoſition, no man can draw nigh to God, nor by any local acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for ſo all men are alike nigh to him who is everywhere, and the worſt as well as the beſt of men do live and move in him: But they are really nigh unto God, who do enjoy him; and they only enjoy him, whoſe natures are conformable to him
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100587:71"/> in a way of love, goodneſs, and God-like perfections. We do not enjoy God by any groſs and external conjunction with him, but we enjoy him, and are nigh unto him <q>by an internal union; when a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, a contact of God, and in Scripture language, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of God face to face, which we are not capable of in this animal concrete ſtate. So may the anſwer of God to <hi>Moſes</hi>

The Viſion of God is not in this life, but in the other; ſo that a man muſt dye before he can thus know God. This is the expoſition of Jewiſh Doctors, and our learned Country-men do approve it alſo.

The ſpirit indeed is willing, but the fleſh is weak.</hi> It ſeems the ſpirit of the weakeſt Chriſtian is ſtrong, though the body (as we have ſeen) of the ſtrongeſt Saint is weak: Though indeed it is not properly the weakneſs that is in the body, that I am to ſpeak to, but the influence that the body hath upon the ſoul to weaken that: for, whilſt the ſoul ſympathizes with the body, attends to it, ſpares it, pities it, ſelf becomes almoſt ill affected to the ſervice of God. I am not ſo much blaming the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, becauſe it had need by reaſon of its ſlothfulneſs to be drawn on to dutie; but becauſe by its influences, it draws off the ſoul alſo from them: for ſo we find it by woful experience, that if the body do ſleep, the ſoul cannot wake; it cannot hear without the ear, nor ſee without the eyes; ſo that the bodyes wearineſs at leng hends in the ſouls unwillingneſs; and

How do they live ſometimes, as it were, without God in the world, their ſouls being ſurfeited with carnal pleaſures, benummed with fears, frozen with ſelf-love, choaked with cares, ſtifled with griefs, and ſeem to have no more feeling of God their life, than a body in the duſt hath of the ſoul its life!

What breakings and piecings, reconciliations and fallings out, cloſing and parting, riſing and falling; what ups and downs; what forwards and backwards doth the poor diſtreſſed ſoul experience in this animal ſtate! The flouriſhing ſoul withers; the lofty ſoul languiſhes; the vigorous ſoul fainteth; the nimble ſoul flaggeth; the devout ſoul ſwooneth; the lively ſoul ſickeneth, and is ready to give up the Ghoſt; and ſhe that was a while ago reſting and glorying in the arms of her Lord, anon lyes embracing a dunghil, and hath almoſt forgotten that ever ſhe was happy: Her peace is violated, her reſt is diſturbed, her converſe with Heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, her incomes from God are few and inſenſible, her outgoings to him are few and lazy, and the rivers of her divine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are almoſt dryed up. And all this, whilſt ſhe is in this body; and indeed a great part of it by reaſon of this body in which ſhe is: The animal body keeps us
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100587:75"/> diſtant from the Lord, that we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him, mind him, enjoy him, live upon him, and unto him. The body being fitted only for this animal ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, is ever drawing down the ſoul, when it would raiſe up it ſelf in contemplation of, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the bleſſed God. And ſo</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Neceſſities</hi> of the body do hinder the ſouls communion with the Lord. Not that the neceſſities of the body are ſimply in themſelves to be blamed, but the caring for theſe doth ſo exerciſe the ſoul in this ſtate, that it cannot attend upon God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtraction. Oh how much doth the neceſſary caring for meat and drink, food and phyſick; yea, the ordering of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affairs, eſtrange from communion and converſe with God! ſo that the ſoul, like poor <hi>Martha,</hi> is cumbred with many cares, and buſied with <hi>much ſerving</hi> in this houſe, and cannot attend ſo devoutly and entirely as it ought; upon the Lord. If the body be pinched with pain, the ſoul cannot be at reſt, but muſt needs look out for relief: If the body be pinched with hunger and thirſt, the ſoul can take no reſt, till it have found out a ſupply for it: If the one be ſick, the other is ſad; if the one be hungry or thirſty, the other ſeems to languiſh; like <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:100587:76"/> his Twins that laught and cryed, lived and dyed together.</p>
            <p>It is a wonderful myſtery, and a rare ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, how the ſoul comes to ſympathize with the body, and to have not only a knowledge, but, as it were, a feeling of its neceſſities; how theſe come to be conveyed to the ſoul, and how it comes to be thus affected with them. But we find it ſo: And indeed, to ſpeak truth, it ſeems neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the maintaining of this animal ſtate, that it ſhould be ſo, that the ſoul ſhould be, as it were, hungry, weary, ſick, and ſleep too together with the body: <q>for if our ſoul ſhould not know what it is to be hungry, thirſty, cold, or ſick, or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but by a bare ratiocination, or a dry ſyllogiſtical inference, without any more eſpecial feeling of theſe neceſſities, it would ſoon ſuffer the body to languiſh and decay, and commit it wholly to all changes and caſualties: neither would our own body be any more to us, than the body of a plant or of a ſtarr, which we do many times view with as much clearneſs, and contemplate with as much contentment as we do our own.</q> But in the mean time, the ſoul is diverted from its main employment, turned aſide from its
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100587:76"/> communion with God; not ſo much by providing ſomewhat for our bodyes to eat, and drink, and put on, which is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and needful, as our Saviour implyes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 32. as by ſinking it ſelf into the body, being paſſionately and inordinately affected with its wants, and ſo being ſinfully thoughtful, as our Saviour intimateth in the ſame chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 31.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Paſſions</hi> of the body do hinder the ſouls communion with the Lord. So powerful is the intereſt and influence that this body hath in and over the ſoul, that it fills it with deſires, pleaſures, griefs, joys, fears, angers, and ſundry paſſions. The body calls out the ſoul to attend upon its ſeveral paſſions, which I dare not ſay are ſinful in themſelves, as they firſt affect our ſouls, no more than it is our ſin that we are men: our bleſſed Saviour ſeems not to have been free from them, as grief, <hi>Iſa</hi> 53. 3. fear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5 7. who yet was free from all ſin, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. Nay, it ſeems neceſſary (as I ſaid before) conſidering the nature of this animal life, that the ſoul ſhould have the corporeal paſſions and impreſſions feelingly and powerfully conveyed to it, without which it could not expreſs a due benevolence to the body that belongs to it;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100587:77"/> and indeed, were it not ſo, we could not properly be ſaid (in the Apoſtles phraſe here) to be at home in the body; the ſoul would rather dwell <hi>in domo alienâ quàm ſuâ.</hi> But the ſoul being called out to attend upon theſe paſſions, is eaſily enſnared by them; for it can hardly exerciſe it ſelf about them, but it ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ps inſenſibly into a ſinful inordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. As for example: <q>The animal ſpirits nimbly playing in the brain, and ſwiftly flying from thence thorow the nerves up and down the whole body, do raiſe the fancy with mirth and chearfulneſs, which we muſt not preſently miſtake for the power of grace, nor condemn for the working of corruption: So alſo when the Gall empties its bitter juice into the liver, and that mingles it ſelf with the blood there, it begets fiery ſpirits, which preſently fly up into the brain, and cauſe impreſſions of anger.</q> Now, though I dare not ſay, that the ſouls firſt ſenſating and entertaining of theſe paſſions is ſinful, yet it is ſadly evident that our ſouls being once moved by theſe undiſciplin'd animal ſpirits, are very apt to fit upon, and cheriſh thoſe paſſions of grief, fear, mirth, anger, and, as it were, to work them into it ſelf, in an inordinate manner, and contrary to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100587:77"/> the dictates of reaſon, and ſo the will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently makes thoſe ſinful, which before were but meerly humane, or as one calls them, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ings forth of animal life within us. We ſee then in theſe particulars, that not only the depraved diſpoſitions of the ſoul do keep us at a diſtance from God, but even this body alſo is a great hinderance to that knowledge of God which we ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to, that ſervice of God which we might perform, and that ſweet communion with him, which we ſhall enjoy. It is a clog to the ſoul that would run; a miſt to the ſoul that would ſee clearly; a manacle to the ſoul that would work; a ſnare to the ſoul that would be free; a fetter to chain it to earthly and material things, and, as it were, a pinion to the wings of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: More particularly, it is a hinderance to it, as to thoſe three things which I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>amed: As to the ſouls knowledge of God, the body is an occaſion of ignorance and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: As to its ſerving of God, an occaſion of diſtract on and wearineſs; lightneſs and triflingneſs; and as to its communion with God, an occaſion of earthlineſs and ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Now this diſtance which this body keeps the ſoul at from God might more
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100587:78"/> particularly appear in another way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, by obſerving the eſpecial grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances that do ariſe to the ſoul from thoſe three great animal faculties (if I may ſo ſpeak.) The Senſes, the Appetite, the Fancy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Senſes,</hi> I mean the external ſenſes of the body; ſeeing, hearing &amp;c. Theſe convey paſſions to the ſoul, upon which it inſiſts and feeds with a ſinful fondneſs and eagerneſs. Set open the eye, and it will ſet hard to convey ſome ſpecies to the ſoul of earthly objects, that ſhall juſtle the Ideas of God out of it. Set open the ear, and it will fill the ſoul with ſuch a noiſe, and earthly tumult, that the ſecret whiſpers of the divine ſpirit cannot be heard. The like I may ſay of the reſt: Oh how eaſily do theſe diſcompoſe the fixed ſoul, diſtract the devout ſoul, caſt a miſt before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative ſoul, and hale down the raiſed ſoul from communion with Heaven to converſe with earthly objects! <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t vidi ut perii!</hi> is the complaint of many a Chriſtian; as well as it was of the Heathen. The ſouls of moſt men are quite ſunk into their ſenſes, and do nothing, but, as it were, lacky to them all their lives, and ſo the ſervants are on horſeback, and Princes go on foot.

But not only theſe, but even godly ſouls are often charmed and enſnared by their ſenſes; even they converſe not only <hi>in</hi> the body, but too much <hi>with</hi> it alſo; and it becomes as a <hi>Dalilah,</hi> to lull them aſleep, and bind them too. Good <hi>Job</hi> found his ſenſes ſo treacherous, that he was fain to make a covenant with them, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 1. And well if he could ſcape ſo too. The words are a Metaphor; for indeed the worſt of it is, that theſe ſenſes are not capable of any diſcipline; one cannot bring them into any covenant-terms: ſo that whilſt we have ſenſes, they will be treacherous; whilſt our eyes are in our heads, they will be wandring after forbidden objects.</p>

This bodily luſt follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the neck of the former, becomes a greater ſnare to the ſoul: This reſtleſs ſuitor comes whining ever and anon to the ſoul for every tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ony, but voluptuouſneſs, laſcivouſneſs, and all manner of ſenſuality. The evil of the ſenſual appetite appears in wantonneſs and laſciviouſneſs (whether real, verbal, or mental) in immoderate and inordinate trading. ingroſſing, ſporting, building, attiring, ſleeping, viſiting, as well as in eating and drinking. I will determine
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100587:79"/> nothing concerning the firſt motions of the appetite, whereby it ſollicits the will to fulfil it; only this, that if it ſollicite to any thing ſimply and morally evil, it is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in that firſt act; and that at all times it ought carefully to be watcht, leſt it ſeduce to intemperance in things lawful. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the gratifying of the appetite, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there muſt be in us a ſenſitive appetite, whilſt we are in this animal ſtate, it is to be endeavoured, as far as may be, that we gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the appetite, not as it is a ſenſitive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, but under this notion, as the thing that it deſires makes for our real good, and tends to the enjoyment of the ſupreme good: to eat and drink, not becauſe we are hungry or thirſty, becauſe the appetite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires it; but with reference to the main end, with reſpect to the higheſt good, that the body may be enabled, ſtrengthened and quickened to wait upon the ſoul chearfully in the actions of a holy life. But this, man in his animal ſtate cannot perfectly attain to, which ſhews, that the appetite doth keep us at a diſtance from God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Fancy;</hi> this alſo keeps a man at a diſtance from God, and hinders us in the knowledge and ſervice of God, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the ſouls communion with God. This
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100587:80"/> is a buſie and petulant faculty, or inward ſenſe, and the ſoul doth readily ſenſate the paſſions of it, ſo that it doth frequently hinder its mental operations, and becomes a great ſnare. A working fancy (how much ſoever it is magnified by the wiſdom of this world) is a mighty ſnare to the ſoul, except it work in a fellowſhip with right reaſon, and a ſanctified heart: I am perſwaded there is no greater burden in the world to a ſerious ſoul; eſpecially in hot and dry conſtitutions, where it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly moſt pregnant, and moſt impatient of diſcipline. And, I confeſs, I have often wondred at the ſouls readineſs to be ſo ſpeedily affected with the fantaſms and imaginations of it, and fondneſs to hug them ſo dearly. This indeed, if it be ſo far refined, as to preſent ſober and ſolid imaginations to the mind, and to act in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervience to ſanctified reaſon, is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent handmaid to the ſoul in many of her functions: But otherwiſe is a ſnare; as we have partly obſerved already, and may obſerve more, if we ſtudy the ſecrets of our own ſouls, and the mighty myſteries that are within us. And this doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordinarily diſturb, diſtract and hinder in ordinary duties, but even when the ſoul is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100587:80"/> at the higheſt pitch of communion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, it aſſayes to pull it down to attend to its vain fantaſms; and indeed gives it many a grievous fall. I doubt not to affirm, that this is the moſt pernicious enemy of the three that I named to the ſouls happineſs, as might appear in many reſpects; I will only name one: It hath an advantage againſt us, which neither of the other two hath: It infeſts us, and annoyes us ſleeping as well as waking. In ſleep, the ſenſes are lockt up, and the appetite is, for the moſt part, ſilent from its begging; but then the fancy is as buſie and tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as ever, forming and gathering imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and thoſe are commonly wild and ſenſeleſs, if not worſe. The mind, in way of kindneſs and benevolence to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſuſpends its own actings, whilſt the body takes its reſt in the night, and then the rude fancy takes its opportunity to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at liberty, as being without its keeper, and acts to the diſturbance of the body; but thats not the worſt, for it becomes ſo tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous and impetuous ſometimes, as that it awakens the mind to attend upon its ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations; and this the ſoul doth conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to in an inordinate manner, and ſets the ſtamp of ſinfulneſs upon them, to its
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100587:81"/> own wounding. And now that I am ſpeaking of ſleep as a <hi>Mantiſſa</hi> to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I cannot but obſerve, how this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing alſo keeps us at a diſtance from God, in this animal ſtate. How is our communion with God interrupted by this! For herein we ceaſe, not only from the actions of an animal life, but commonly from the actions of a ſpiritual life too. What a great breach, what a ſad interciſion is there made in our converſe with God by this means! Such a poor happineſs it is, that we have in this world, that it is cut off, and ſeems, as it were, not to be one fourth part of our time: For indeed a happineſs that is not felt, deſerves not the name of happineſs. Some learned and active men have been aſhamed that they have ſlept away ſo much of their time, which was all too little for their ſtudyes and exploits: Ah poor Chriſtian, that, as it were, ſleeps away ſo much of his God, being as much eſtranged from him in the night, as though he had never converſed with him in the day; and in the morning when he awakes, cannot alwayes find himſelf with him nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which is enough to make a poor Saint wiſh, either that he might have no need of ſleep, or that with the amorous

            <p>We have ſeen in what ſenſe this mortal body keeps Believers abſent from the Lord, and in what reſpects it keeps them at a diſtance from God, even in this life, from the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God, the <hi>Service</hi> of God, and <hi>Communion</hi> with him. Here then by way of Application;</p>
            <p n="1">1. We may ſee that it was for good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the bleſſed Apoſtle is confident, and willing to depart; nay, groans within himſelf, deſiring that <hi>mortality might be ſwallowed up of life,</hi> as he ſpeaks, <hi>v.</hi> 4. I told you before, that theſe words did contain the reaſon or ground thereof; and by this time I hopw you ſee that the reaſon is good, and the ground is ſufficient. What will the men of this world ſay? Will you perſwade us out of our life? Should any thing in the world make a man weary of his life? <hi>Proeſtat miſerum eſſe quam non eſſe:</hi> The Apoſtle was ſure beſides himſelf, or he would never have fallen out with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100587:82"/> what became of him. No, none of theſe: The Apoſtle was in his right wits, and in a ſober mind too. It was not a paſſion, or a fit of melancholly, but his judgement and choice upon good deliberation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you find him in the ſame mind elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>Phil. 1. 23. I deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is far better.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he gives a reaſon for what he deſires; now we know that paſſion is unruly and unreaſonable. Neither was the Apoſtle beſides himſelf; for he gives a good, ſolid and wiſe reaſon,—<hi>Whilſt we are at home in the body, &amp;c.</hi> He will part with his life, rather than not be perfectly happy. For, whereas worldlings put ſuch a high price upon life, and think that nothing ſhould perſwade men out of their lives: Its true indeed, if we ſpeak properly, life is the perfection of the creature: The happineſs of every thing is its life: <hi>A living Dog is better than a dead Lion,</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 4. But I may ſay to theſe, even as our Saviour ſaid to that woman, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 18. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Husband; The life that we live here, is not our life. The union of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive ſoul with the body, is indeed truly and properly the life of a beaſt, and its greateſt happineſs; for it is capable of no
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100587:82"/> higher perfection: But the union of the rational ſoul with God, is the nobleſt perfection of man, and his higheſt life: ſo that the life of a believing ſoul is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed at death, but perfected. Neither was the Apoſtle weary of his life, becauſe of the adverſities of it. The Apoſtle was of a braver ſpirit ſure than any Stoick; he durſt live, though he rather deſired to dye. All the conflicts he endured with the world, never wrung ſuch a ſigh from him, as the conflict that he had with his own corruptions did, <hi>Rom. 7. 24. O wretched man, &amp;c.</hi> All the perfecutions in the world never made him groan ſo much, as the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of his fleſh doth here, and his great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Lord. A godly ſoul can converſe with perſecuting men, and a tempting Devil, can handle briars and thorns, can grapple with any kind of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and adverſities in the fleſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſpondency, ſo long as it finds it ſelf in the boſome of God, and in the arms of Omnipotence. But when it begins to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider where it is, how far it is from its God, its life, and the happy ſtate that God hath prepared it for, then it cannot but groan within it ſelf, and be ready with <hi>Peter,</hi> to caſt it ſelf out of the ſhip, to get to its God;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100587:83"/> to land it ſelf in eternity. Neither indeed (to ſpeak truly) is it only the ſenſe of ſin againſt God, which ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s the godly ſoul a going: For, though it muſt be confeſt, that this is a heavy burden upon the ſoul, yet the Apoſtle makes no complaint of this here, but only of his diſtance from God, that neceſſary diſtance from God that the body kept him it at.</p>
            <p n="2">2. See here the excellent ſpirit of true Religion. Godly ſouls do groan after an unbodyed eſtate, not only becauſe of their ſins in the body, but even becauſe of the neceſſary diſtance at which the body keeps them from God. We may ſuppoſe a godly ſoul at ſome time to have no manner of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction in the world to grieve him, no ſin unpardoned, unrepented of to trouble him; yet for all this he is not at perfect reſt; he is burdened and groans within himſelf, becauſe he is at ſuch a diſtance from that abſolute good, whom he longs to know more familiarly, and enjoy more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100587:83"/> with him face to face. Bare innocency, or freedom from ſin, cannot ſatisfie that noble and large ſpirit that is in a truly and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſoul; but that ſpirit of true goodneſs (being nothing elſe but an efflux from God himſelf) carryes the ſoul out after a more intimate union with that Being from whence it came: God dwelling in the ſoul, doth by a ſecret mighty power draw the ſoul more and more to himſelf. In a word, a godly ſoul, that is really toucht with the ſenſe of divine ſweetneſs and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Suffer me from hence to expoſtulate a

Why do we ſo pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per this body? Why ſo anxiouſly ſtudious to keep it up, ſo dreadfully afraid of the ruines of it? If we take the Apoſtles words in the firſt ſenſe that I named, then I may ask with him in the firſt verſe; <hi>Know we not, that if our earthly houſe of this tabernacle were diſſolved, we had a building of God, a houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens?</hi> or <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. Why are we not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling rather to be <hi>abſent from the body,</hi> and to be <hi>preſent with the Lord?</hi> If we take them in the latter ſenſe, as this animal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is an hinderance to the ſouls knowledge of, and communion with God, then I ask concerning this, as the Apoſtle doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning rich men, <hi>James</hi> 2. 6. Why do ye pamper, prize, honour, dote upon this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? Doth not this body oppreſs you, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract you, burden you, clog you, hinder you?

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100587:84"/> from him; even as the dark body of the earth interpoſes between the Sun and Moon, to ecclipſe its light? Why are we not rather weary, that we are in the body? Surely there are ſome objections, ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments to the ſouls longing after its hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſtate, which I ſhall come to anon: But I doubt alſo, that there is ſomething that chains the ſoul to this animal life; ſome cords in this earthly tabernacle, that tye up the ſoul in it: but I cannot well imagine what they ſhould be. Say not, There is ſomething of God to be enjoyed in this life, which makes it pleaſant: For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this be true, yet, I am ſure, God gives nothing of himſelf to a ſoul, thereby to clog it or cloy it. Did <hi>Moſes</hi> ſend for ſome Cluſters of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> into the wilderneſs, think ye, that the people might ſee and taſte the fruits, and ſit ſtill, and be ſatisfied, and ſay, Oh it is enough; we ſee that there are pleaſant things in that Land, we will never come at it? or, did he not do it rather that they might make the more haſte to poſſeſs themſelves of it? Will any man ſay, Away, I will have no more land, no more mony, I have ſome already? Can a godly ſoul ſay, God hath given me an earneſt, I deſire no more? No,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100587:85"/> no; but the report that a Chriſtian hears of a reſt remaining, a happy life remaining for it, and the chariots of divine graces that he ſees God hath ſent out into his ſoul to convey it thither, make him cry out, not with <hi>Jacob, Gen. 45. 28. It is enough,</hi> Joſeph <hi>my Son is yet alive, I will go and ſee him before I dye:</hi> But oh this is not enough, this report is not enough; it is not enough that I taſte ſome of the good things of the Land; it is not enough that I ſee theſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages ſent out for me; it is not enough that my ſoul hath an happy and honourable life prepared for it; I ſee it indeed before I dye, but I will alſo dye, that I may ſee it better, and enjoy it more. But I doubt there is ſome earthly tye, even upon the heavenly ſoul that chains it to this preſent animal body: But, ſure I am, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, it is but a weak one. Is there any worldly accommodation, any creature-toy, that ſhould in reaſon ſtep between a ſoul and its God? Is this life ſweet, becauſe there are creature comforts to be enjoyed? And will it not be a better life, when crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comforts ſhall not be needed? And are the pleaſures of this body, the comforts of this life, the flattering ſmiles, or fawning embraces of the creature, ſuch a mighty
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100587:85"/> contentment to a ſoul, to a ſoul acquainted with the higheſt good? Haſt thou, O my ſoul, any ſuch full and ſatisfying entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in thy Pilgrimage, as to make thee loath to go home? Wilt thou hide thy ſelf with <hi>Saul</hi> among the <hi>ſtuff,</hi> among the lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the world, when thou art ſought for to be crowned? Are the empty ſounds of popular applauſe, the breaking bubbles of ſecular greatneſs, the ſhallow ſtreams of ſenſual pleaſures, the ſmiling dalliance, and liſping eloquence of wives and children, the flying ſhadows of creature-refreſhments, the momentany flouriſhes of worldly beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and bravery, Are theſe meat for a ſoul? Are theſe the proper object, or the main happineſs of ſuch a divine thing, as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul? Why are we not rather wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this body, that makes us ſo weary of heavenly employment? Why do we not rather long to part with that life, that parts us from our life?

I might ſpeak as a Philoſopher, and ſhew how unbecoming a man, and how deſtructive to him this paſſion is; ſo much, that whilſt it doth predominate, it almoſt robs him of that which is his greateſt glory, even reaſon it ſelf. But, to ſay no worſe of it, is very oppoſite, if not contrary to that noble grace of Faith, whereby the ſteady ſoul reſteth and lodgeth in the arms of God, as in its center. But to ſpeak to the thing in hand, what an unſeemly paſſion is this?
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100587:89"/> we would have the world to believe that we have layd up our happineſs in God, and that we are troubled that we are ſo far from him; and yet we are afraid leſt that ſhould be taken out of the way that keeps us at a diſtance from him: We flatter our ſelves that we are in haſte for Heaven, and yet we are dreadfully afraid leſt our rubs ſhould be taken out of the way. How do theſe things hang together? Are we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that if this earthly houſe of our tabernacle were taken down, we have a building not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens? If not, Why do we yet call our ſelves Chriſtians? But I think I may take it for granted, we are all ſo perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: And if ſo, Why are we ſo afraid it ſhould be taken down? I am loath to ſpeak what I think; yet methinks the entire and ardent love which we either do bear, or ought to bear to the Bleſſed God, and union and communion with him, ſhould caſt out this fear: This is ſuitable to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 18. I will not diſpute how far ſinful fear for the body may carry a godly ſoul; the further, the worſe I am ſure: But if any will needs be ſo indulgent to his own paſſions, and ſo much an enemy to his own peace, as to encourage himſelf
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100587:89"/> to fear (which is a ſtrange thing) from the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> denying his wife; or <hi>Peter,</hi> denying his Lord; let him compare the iſſue, and then let me ſee whether he dare go and do likewiſe: But if that will not fright you from fear, chew upon theſe two Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I pray you ſeriouſly diſpute the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with your ſelves, how far fear of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and death may conſiſt with that ardent thirſt after union and perfect communion with the Bleſſed God, with which we ought to be poſſeſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Diſpute ſeriouſly how far it can ſtand with the ſincerity of a Chriſtian. God hath not left us in the dark, as to this matter. I will turn you to a Text or two, which, methinks, ſhould ſtrike cold to all ſlaviſh trembling Profeſſors, <hi>Prov. 28. 1. Job 15. 20, 21. The wicked travelleth with pain all his dayes, a dreadful ſound is in his ears:</hi> They are the words of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> indeed, but they do agree with the words of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Iſa. 33. 14. The ſinners in</hi> Sion <hi>are afraid, fearfulneſs hath ſurprized the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites:</hi> When I read over theſe Texts, I cannot but pray, and cry, O my ſoul, come not you into the number of the wicked, and be not united into the aſſembly of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites!</p>
            <pb n="146" facs="tcp:100587:90"/>
            <p>2. Take heed of <hi>fondneſs</hi> of the body: of a double act of it, <hi>priding, pampering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Take heed you <hi>pride</hi> not your ſelves in any excellencies of the body. Doth this mortal body keep us at a diſtance from our God? Do we well then to love that which keeps us from that which is moſt lovely? Why do we ſtand fondly gazing upon that which keeps us from the bleſſed ſight of God? If you ask me, Did ever any man hate his own fleſh? I will ask you again, Did ever any wiſe man love his own fleſh above him that made it? Did ever any godly ſoul love his body in oppoſition to his God? Oh, but it is a comely body! And what is a beautiful body, but a fair priſon? A ſilver twiſt, or a clog of gold, do as really hinder the flight of a Bird, and foreſtall her liberty, as a ſtone tyed at her heels. Nay, thoſe very excellencies which you ſo much admire, are ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hinderances. If we had learned that excellent leſſon indeed, of enjoying all things only in God, then the ſeveral beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and braveries of the body, would be a help to our devotion, they would carry us up to an admiration and contemplation of that glorious and moſt excellent Being, from whom they were communicated: ſo
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100587:90"/> we might (in ſome ſenſe) look into a glaſs, and behold the beauty of God. But (alas!) theſe commonly prove the greater ſnares: Many had been more beautiful within, had they been leſs beautiful without; more chaſte, if leſs comely; many had been more peacèable, and more at peace too, if they had been leſs able to have quarrelled and fought. It was ſaid of <hi>Galba,</hi> who was an ingenious man, but deformed, that his ſoul dwelt ill: but, ſure I am, it might better have been ſo ſaid of beautiful <hi>Abſolom,</hi> or <hi>Jezabel,</hi> whoſe bodies became a ſnare to their ſouls. On the other hand, they that want a beauty in their bodyes, will perhaps labour to find an excellency in their minds far beyond it; as the Philoſopher adviſed to look often into a glaſs, <hi>ut ſi deformis ſis, corrigas formoſitate morum, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Take heed of <hi>pampering</hi> the body, of treating it too gently and delicately. Deny it nothing that may fit it for the ſervice of God and your ſouls, and allow it no more than may do that. Thy pampering is 1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſeemly:</hi> What, make a darling of that which keeps us from our Lord! carry it gently, and delicately, and tenderly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that, which whilſt we carry about with us we cannot be happy! 2. <hi>Injurious:</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:100587:91"/> If you bring up this <hi>ſervant</hi> delicately from a child, you ſhall have him become your <hi>Son</hi> at length, yea, your Maſter. If you do by your bodyes, as the fond King did by his Son <hi>Adonijah, 1 King.</hi> 1. 6. never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe it, never reprove it, never deny it; it will do with you in time as he did, raiſe ſeditions in your ſoul. Go on and pleaſe, and pamper, and cocker your bodyes, and it will come to this at length, that you muſt deny them nothing; you muſt <hi>give</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a whining appetite will crave, <hi>go</hi> whither your gadding ſenſes will carry you, and <hi>ſpeak</hi> whatſoever wanton fancy will ſuggeſt. Doth not the body it ſelf ſet us at a ſufficient diſtance from God; but we muſt eſtrange our ſelves more from him by pleaſuring it, ſpend the time that ſhould be for God, in decking, trimming, adorning it? When you cram this, you feed a Bird that will pick out your eyes; you nouriſh a Traitor, when you gratifie this <hi>Adonijah.</hi> In a word, Is it not enough that we do all carry fire in our boſomes, but we muſt alſo blow it up into a flame; <hi>Nay, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, do not ſo fooliſhly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, methinks, by this time, I may venture upon an Exhortation; by degrees at leaſt.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:100587:91"/>1. <hi>Watch againſt the Body.</hi> You have heard how the ſenſes, appetite and fancy become a ſnare to the ſouls <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing unto, and converſing with God: Now then, if you ſeriouſly deſign communion with Heaven, if you placed your happineſs in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and enjoyment of that ſupreme and eternal good, it becomes you to watch againſt all things that may diſtract or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert you from it, or make you fall ſhort of the glory of God. Men that live upon earthly deſigns, whoſe great ambition it is to be great in the world, do not only uſe the moſt effectual means, and take the moſt direct courſes to accompliſh thoſe deſigns, and attain thoſe ends, but do continually ſuſpect, and diligently watch againſt all the moths that would corrupt, the ruſt that would conſume, the thieves that would plunder their treaſures; and, in a word, againſt all poſſible hinderances, defrauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and diſappointments: So will we ſuſpect and watch ſure againſt all enemies and traitors to our ſouls, if we live here upon eternal deſigns, if our ambition be to be great in God alone. And the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent the danger is, the more will we watch. Have you not found by experience, which of theſe three have been moſt prejudicial to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100587:92"/> your communion with God? If not, you have not been ſo ſtudious to know the ſtate, nor purſue the happineſs of your own ſouls as you might: If ſo, then watch againſt that moſt of all, which you have found to be moſt injurious. For it ordinarily comes to paſs, either by the difference of conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, or difference of temptations, or different wayes of living, or ſome other thing, that Gods children are more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared by ſome one of theſe than other. Well, be ſure to watch and pray, and ſtrive more eſpecially againſt the more eſpecial enemies of your ſouls.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Live above the body:</hi> above bodily enjoyments, ornaments, excellencies. Though theſe bodily enjoyments be never ſo ſweet, theſe bodily ornaments never ſo glorious, yet is not your happineſs in theſe. Certainly they live to their loſs, who live upon the excellencies of their own ſouls, whether natural or ſupernatural; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themſelves of the infinite glory, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſufficiency that is in the Bleſſed God, who take up their happineſs in theſe: Much more do they pinch and impoveriſh their own ſouls, who live upon bodily or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, or excellencies; wherein many inferiour creatures do excel them; the Roſe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100587:92"/> in beauty, the Sun in brightneſs, the Lion in ſtrength, the Stagg in ſwiftneſs, &amp;c. If a woman were as lovely as the morning, <hi>fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun:</hi> if a man were full of perſonal grace and majeſty, <hi>terrible as an Army with banners;</hi> yet were not their happineſs in theſe accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Nay, which is worſe, theſe orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſtand between us and our happineſs. When you begin therefore at any time fondly to admire any of theſe bodily excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, then think with your ſelves, Oh but all theſe do not make my ſoul happy: Nay, this beautiful outſide muſt ſtink, and be deformed; theſe fair and flouriſhing members muſt wither in the duſt; this active, ſtrong and graceful body, muſt be buryed in diſgrace and weakneſs, before I can attain to entire and perfect happineſs. This conſideration will advance us to live above the body.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Be content to be unbodyed for a time.</hi> Is it true, that we can no otherwiſe be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, no otherwiſe be preſent with God, know him familiarly, enjoy him perfectly and entirely? cannot we get to him, except we go thorow the duſt? Be it ſo then; be content to be unbodyed for a time. <hi>Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat modo imperet,</hi> could the Heathen ſay
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100587:93"/> concerning her Son; much rather may a Chriſtian ſay concerning his Father, Let him ſlay me, ſo my ſoul may but reign with him, which is by his reigning in it; Let him kill me, ſo he will but fill me; Let him draw me thorow the duſt of the earth, ſo he will but draw me out of this duſt of the world, ſo he will but draw me nigh unto himſelf, and bring me into a full and inſeparable conjunction with my Lord! Methinks I need not uſe many arguments to perſwade a ſoul that is feelingly overpowered, maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, raviſhed with the infinite beauty, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, glory and fulneſs of his God, to be willing to quit a duſty tabernacle for a time, wherein it is almoſt ſwallowed up, to depart, and to be entirely ſwallowed up in him. Nay, ſuppoſe a Chriſtian in the loweſt form, who hath but choſen God for his higheſt good and only happineſs (as every ſincere Chriſtian hath) methinks he ſhould have learnt this leſſon, to comply with that infinite, perfect will, that governs both him and the whole world: I cannot conceive a godly ſoul without the ſubduing of ſelf-will; nor ſuppoſe a ſincere Saint void at leaſt of the habit of ſelf-reſignation. Therefore I will add no more concerning this, but riſe a ſtep higher.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:100587:93"/>4. <hi>Long after an unbodyed ſtate,</hi> deſire to depart, and to be with the Lord, groan within your ſelves to have morality ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of life; in which temper you find the holy Apoſtle. To be <hi>content</hi> to dye, is a good temper, a temper ſcarce to be found (I think) in any wicked man; not from a right principle, I am ſure: But, methinks, its no very great thing in compariſon of what we ſhould labour to attain to. Think on't a little; what a ſtrange kind of cold uncouth phraſe it is, Such a man is content to be happy! Men are not ſaid to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be rich, but covetous; not willing to be honoured, but <hi>ambitious:</hi> And why ſhould it only be content to be with God? I am perſwaded there is no ſhew nor ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of ſatisfactory bliſs and happineſs for a ſoul, a noble immortal nature, but only in the ſupreme eſſential, perfect, abſolute good, the bleſſed and eternal good: And, ſhould not this noble active Being be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed out with vehement longings after its proper and full happineſs, as well as this earthly ſluggiſh body is carryed with reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs appetite after health, and ſafety, and liberty? Why ſhould a ſoul alone be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be happy, when all other things in the world, do ſo ardently court, and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100587:94"/> purſue their reſpective ends, and ſeveral perfections? Certainly if the bleſſed and glorious God ſhould diſplay himſelf in all his beauty, and open all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite treaſures of goodneſs, and ſweetneſs and fulneſs within the view of a ſoul, it could not but be raviſhed with the object, earneſtly preſs into his preſence, <hi>ruere in amplexus,</hi> and with a holy impatience throw it ſelf into his arms: There would be need of ſetting bounds to the Mount, to keep it from breaking thorow unto the Lord: what is ſaid of the Queen of the South, when ſhe had heard the wiſdom, and ſeen the glory of <hi>Solomon, 2 Chron.</hi> 9. 4. would be more true of a Chriſtian, there would be <hi>no more ſpirit left</hi> in him. Some have therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the wiſdom of God in engaging the ſoul in ſo dear a union with the body, that it might care for it, and not quit it: Yea, the Heathen obſerved the wiſdom of God in concealing the happy ſtate of a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſoul, that ſo men might be content to live out their time, <hi>victuroſque Dii celant, ut vivere durent, Foelix eſſe mori.</hi> But alas, we ſee but darkly as thorow a glaſs, and our affections towards God are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to our apprehenſions of him; theſe are dark, and therefore thoſe are
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100587:94"/> dull. And oh would to God they were but indeed proportionable! for then we ſhould love him only, if not earneſtly; and deſire him entirely, if not ſufficiently. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what I have hinted, concerning the happineſs of the ſoul in the enjoyment of God, and what I have more fully demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated concerning the bodyes hindering of it, and keeping it at a diſtance; and then argue, Is happineſs the main end of every Being? Muſt not this ſoul then, being a noble and immortal nature, needs look out for ſome high and noble happineſs, ſuitable to its excellent ſelf? Can that be any where, but in the enjoyment of the higheſt and uncreated good? And can this never be attained whilſt we are in this animal ſtate, in this mortal body, that keeps at ſuch a diſtance? Oh why then do we not look out after ſo much enjoyment of this bleſſed God, as we are now capable of, and long after a departure hence, that we may enjoy him freely and fully, and be eternally happy in him! oh be not only content, but even covetous.</p>
            <p>But what, ſhall the ſoul break the cage that ſhe may take her flight? God forbid! How can he pretend to be a lover of God, who is not formed into his will, ſubject to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100587:95"/> his ordination, content to abide in the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he hath allotted him? But if we may not break it to eſcape, yet methinks it may be ſafe enough, with ſubmiſſion to wiſh it were broken: If we may not with <hi>Saul, diſſolve</hi> our ſelves, yet with <hi>Paul,</hi> we may <hi>deſire to be diſſolved.</hi> The perfection that the moſt Chriſtians attain to, is but to <hi>deſire to live,</hi> and be <hi>content to dye:</hi> Oh, conſider what I have ſaid in this matter, and invert the order of thoſe words in your hearts, <hi>Be content to live, deſire to dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what, would you have us pray for death? Anſwer, I ſpeak not of a formal praying either for one or other. What the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the greateſt of ſins, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 16. I am ready to ſay of this ſtate of freedom from all ſin, <hi>I do not ſay that ye ſhould pray for it.</hi> You will tell me that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Hez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But I will not enveigle my ſelf in any controverſie: Methinks the ſad conſideration layd before your eyes, whilſt we are in the body we are abſent, diſtant from the Lord, ſhould wring out an <hi>O wretched man that I am, &amp;c.</hi> or an <hi>I deſire

            <p>But can a ſoul poſſibly long for the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> of the body? Philoſophy indeed tells us that it cannot.

But to take off this plea at once.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our earneſt longings after a full and perfect enjoyment of God, and ſo our breathings after an immortal ſtate doth not depend upon our aſſurance; but indeed aſſurance rather depends upon that. I doubt we are commonly miſtaken in the nature of aſſurance; and, it may be, are in a wrong manner curious about the <hi>ſigns</hi> of Chriſts <hi>appearing</hi> in our ſouls. For, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a well grounded aſſurance of the love of God, doth moſt diſcover and unfold it ſelf in the growth of true godlineſs in the ſoul: Now the love of God, and an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire to be like unto him, and to be with him, is the better half of all religion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37, 38. ſo that it rather ſeems
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100587:96"/> that aſſurance ſprings up from this frame of ſoul, than that this ariſes out of aſſurance. If aſſurance be the thing that you deſire, get your ſouls joyned to God in a union of affections, will, and ends, and then labour and long to be cloſer to him, liker to him, perfectly holy and happy in him, and be ye aſſured that Chriſt is in you of a truth: For theſe mighty works which he hath wrought, theſe divine breathings, theſe holy pantings after him do bear witneſs of him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether ever you come to that feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowledge, that powerful ſenſe of your ſtate or no, which you call aſſurance, yet know, that it is your duty to long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter immortality. We are wont to call aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance the priviledge of ſome few; but the Scripture makes this temper that I am ſpeaking of, the duty of all Believers, which I do the rather name, becauſe I find few Profeſſors of this temper; and indeed but few that are willing to believe that they ought to be. Our Saviour calls all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to as much in effect as I do, <hi>Luk. 21. 28. Look up and lift up your heads, for the day of your redemption draweth nigh:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is not meant a bare poſture and ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but joy and longing are required by

Conſider further (which, methinks, ſhould ſtrike cold to the hearts of cold-hearted Profeſſors) that this very temper is made one of the greateſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of true and ſincere Saints: I do not know of any one oftner named; See <hi>Rom. 8. 23. We groan within our ſelves, waiting for the redemption of our body,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 8. <hi>The Lord ſhall give the Crown to them that love his appearing,</hi> Tit. 2. 13.

In which words this Doctrine is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly layd down (for I ſhall not meddle with the Controverſie.)</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That the glorified Saints ſhall be as the Angels of God in Heaven.</hi> The other Evangeliſts do lay down the ſame truth, as you may find, <hi>Mark 12. 25. Luk.</hi> 20. 36. In the explication of which point, I will ſhew 1. <hi>Negatively,</hi> wherein the Saints ſhall not be like the Angels. 2. <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:100587:100"/> wherein they ſhall be like unto them; or, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> hath it, <hi>equal</hi> to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively, The glorified Saints ſhall not be like the Angels in eſſence:</hi> The Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical eſſence, and the rational ſoul are, and ſhall be different. Souls ſhall remain ſouls ſtill, keep their own eſſence: The eſſence ſhall not be changed; ſouls ſhall not be changed into Angelical eſſences.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They ſhall not be wholly ſpirits, without bodyes,</hi> as the Angels: The ſpirit of juſt men now made perfect, are more line to the Angels in this ſenſe, than they ſhall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Reſurrection: For now they are ſpirits without bodyes; but the Saints ſhall have bodyes; not ſuch as now (ſo corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, ſo crazy) not in any thing defective, not needing creature ſupplyes; But incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, glorious bodyes, in ſome ſenſe ſpiritual bodyes; which are deſcribed by three characters, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 42, 43.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100587:101"/> and make them like unto his glorious body, <hi>Phil. 3. ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Neither have we any ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Saints ſhall be altogether <hi>equal to the Angels in dignity and glory:</hi> But rather, that as man was at firſt made a little lower than the Angels; ſo that he ſhall never come to be exalted altogether ſo high as they: for it ſeemeth, that the natural capacity of an Angel, is greater than of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>; and ſo ſhall continue; for they are diſtinct kinds of creatures. As a beaſt cannot become ſo wiſe and intelligent as a man; for then he would ceaſe to be a beaſt: ſo neither can a man become ſo large and capable as an Angel; for then he would ceaſe to be a man.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> The glorified Saints ſhall be like the Angels of God in Heaven; firſt, In their <hi>qualities;</hi> that is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In being <hi>pure and holy;</hi> whether they ſhall be equal to them in poſitive holineſs, or no, I know not: whether they ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and know, and love God, in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as much as the Angels: It ſeems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they ſhall not; becauſe, as I ſaid before, their capacity ſhall not be ſo large. But if in this they be not altogether equal to the Angels, yet it implyes no imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100587:101"/> for they ſhall be poſitively holy as far as their nature is capable; and ſo ſhall be perfect in their kind, <hi>Heb. 12. 23. The ſpirits of Juſt men made perfect:</hi> They ſhall in this be like unto the Angels, if not equal to them; yea like unto God himſelf in it; <hi>Be ye holy as I am holy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 15. Mat. 5. <hi>ult.</hi> But as to negative holineſs, the Saints ſhall be even equal to the Angels of God in Heaven, <hi>i. e.</hi> they ſhall have no more ſin, no more corruption than they have. They ſhall be as perfectly freed from all iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, imperfections, and infirmities, as the Angels. What can be cleaner than that which hath no uncleanneſs at all in it? Why, ſo clean ſhall all the Saints be, <hi>Rev. 21. 27. No unclean thing ſhall enter into Heaven.</hi> They ſhall be without all kind of <hi>ſpot or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 27. which is a perfect nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive holineſs: more cannot be ſaid of the Angels in this reſpect.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100587:102"/> to our God who ſitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lamb:</hi> The Angels ſtood round about ſaying <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. In their readineſs to do the will of God, and execute his commands; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Angels are deſcribed to have wings, <hi>Iſa. 6. 2. with twain they did fly.</hi> How God ſhall pleaſe to imploy Angels or Saints in the world to come, is not for us to enquire: But they ſhall be alike ready to do his will, and ſerve his pleaſure, whatever it ſhall be. Even whilſt the Saints are imperfect on earth, they can cry, <hi>Here am I, ſend me,</hi> Iſa. 6. 8. How much more ready ſhall they be then, when all their fetters are knockt off!</p>
            <p n="4">4. They ſhall be as the Angels in their <hi>chearful</hi> and <hi>unwearied</hi> execution of the will of God: So the Angels are, and ſo ſhall the Saints be.

More things of this nature might be added: but I paſs lightly over them, becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be true, yet they are not prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally lookt at in this Text: therefore I come to the ſecond thing wherein the glorified Saints ſhall be like unto the Angels, and that is;</p>
            <pb n="171" facs="tcp:100587:102"/>
            <p>2. In their <hi>way of living.</hi> They ſhall be like the Angels, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſaith one truly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, living like the Angels: How is that? our Saviour tells us, Neither marrying, nor being given in marriage: it is added preſently in <hi>Luk. 20. 36. For neither can they dye any more:</hi> If there be no dying, there will be no need of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; if no need of propagation, then why ſhould they marry? The Angels are ſingle, and know no other conjunction, but with God in a ſpiritual manner: no more ſhall the Saints. But what great matter is that to be like the Angels in? what perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is that? Many Saints, yea and ſinners too upon earth, are ſo like the Angels; nay, and the Devils too. Therefore you muſt know that our Saviour under this phraſe of not marrying, &amp;c. doth comprehend all manner of <hi>creature-converſe,</hi> all kind of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon, and delighting in the creature, by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> of the part, as is ordinary in Scripture; <hi>I have not given upon uſury,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, yet the people curſe me, <hi>Jer. 15. 10. i. e.</hi> I have had no deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the world, no negotiation: By one kind he underſtands the whole, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25. 41. where, by eating their fruits, and drinking their milk, is underſtood the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100587:103"/> poſſeſſing of all that was theirs: And in many other places, the Spirit of God uſes this Tropical way of ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>The Angels of God neither marry, nor are given in marriage, <hi>i. e.</hi> they live not upon any created good, delight not in any created comfort; but live entirely upon God, converſe with him, are ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly beholding his glory, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in him: Thus ſhall the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints live for ever. Their bodyes ſhall not need nor uſe created ſupplyes, food, phyſick, rayment, &amp;c. which things in this animal ſtate they ſtand in need of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 32. But that's not all; for their ſouls ſhall not any longer deſire, nor han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker after any created thing; but (as the Angels) ſhall be poſſeſt of God, filled with the fulneſs of God; all the powers and faculties of them perfectly refined and ſpiritualized, abſtracted from all created things, eternally rejoycing and delighting themſelves in the contemplation and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the ſupreme and infinite good: For during this earthly and imperfect ſtate, not only the bodyes of good men feed upon, and are ſuſtained by the creatures in common with other men, but even their ſouls do taſte too much of worldly content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100587:103"/> and drink too deep of earthly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and creature-comforts: Even the moſt refined ſouls upon earth, though they do not properly feed upon any thing below God, yet do oſt dip the end of their Rod in this hony that lyes upon the earth (with <hi>Jonathan</hi>) do caſt an unchaſte eye upon their earthly enjoyments, and delight in them in a way too groſs and unſpiritual, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving abſtracted them from God, and loving them with a diſtinct love. But in the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection it ſhall not be ſo: for the holy ſouls ſhall be perfectly conformed to the holy God, ſhall feed upon him ſingly, live upon him entirely, be wrapt up in him wholly, and be ſatisfied in him ſolely and everlaſtingly: and ſo ſhall they be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>equal to the Angels.</hi> The creature, although it do not fill any truly ſanctified ſoul upon earth, yet it hath ſome room there; but then it ſhall be perfectly caſt out, and the ſoul ſhall be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with all the fulneſs of God: the creature is now much in ſome godly ſouls, and ſomething in all of them; but then it ſhall be nothing at all to them, or in them; but God ſhall be <hi>all in all;</hi> all things in all of them; as the way of the Saints living, and their glorified ſtate is deſcribed, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 28. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that God
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100587:104"/> may be all in all. They ſhall inherit all things:</hi> but how is that? why, ſee the explication of it in the following words, God will be their God, <hi>Rev. 21. 7. He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things, and I will be his God.</hi> God ſhall be unto them inſtead of all things. In that ſtate there ſhall be no need of Sun or Moon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 23. by which excellent and uſeful creatures, the whole Creation ſeems to be underſtood; for they that ſhall live above the Sun and Moon, ſhall certainly live above all things that are below theſe: But how then? why it follows, <hi>The glory of God ſhall enlighten them; and the Lamb ſhall be their light:</hi> ſo <hi>Rev. 22. 5. And there ſhall be no night there, and they need no Candle, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light of the Sun; for the Lord giveth them light:</hi> All happineſs is derived into them from God; and therefore there ſhall be no night; no want of any creature-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to them; neither ſhall they deſire any thing more of the creature, whether <hi>ſmall</hi> or <hi>great,</hi> whether <hi>Candle</hi> or <hi>Sun.</hi> For expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this their bleſſed life, let me allude to that of our Saviour, <hi>Luk. 12. 24. The Fowls of the Heaven neither ſow nor reap,</hi> yet God feedeth them: ſo the Saints of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven neither want nor deſire any created good; for they feed upon God the ſupreme
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100587:104"/> and infinite good: And again, <hi>verſ. 27. The Lillies neither toyl nor ſpin, and yet</hi> Solomon <hi>in all his glory was not arrayed like one of theſe:</hi> Theſe bleſſed ſouls have no reſpect at all to things terrene &amp; created; yet are they ſo filled and adorned with the glory of the infinite Majeſty, that <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his glory was a filthy and ragged thing in compariſon of them. In a word, the ſtate of the glorified Saints and Angels is ſet out by our Saviour in the ſame manner, by one and the ſame deſcription, and that is the ſeeing of God: The life of Angels, is called a continual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of the face of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 10. and the ſtate of the Saints glory and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is alſo a ſeeing of God, <hi>Mat. 5. 8. Heb. 12. 14. Rev. 22. 4. They ſhall ſee his face, and his name ſhall be in their foreheads.</hi> Now this phraſe, the ſeeing of God, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both to the Saints and Angels, doth place their happineſs in God alone, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the creature; and it doth import the fulneſs, and clearneſs, and certainty of that their bliſs.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewed you in what <hi>ſenſe</hi> (though I am not able to ſhew you in what <hi>degree</hi>) the glorified Saints ſhall be like the Angels of God in Heaven: Their way of living, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the bleſſed God alone,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100587:105"/> ſhall be the ſame with that of the holy Angels. Application.</p>
            <p>From the diſcovery of the future ſtate of the Saints, I find my ſelf filled with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Reproof:</hi> Againſt the <hi>carnal conceits</hi> that many Chriſtians have of Heaven. <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do I call them! Nay, herein they ſeem rather <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> who place Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the full and laſting enjoyment of all creature-comforts; nay indeed of ſinful and abominable pleaſures, as one may read in their <hi>Alcoran.</hi> It may be few Chriſtians are altogether ſo ſenſual; but, ſure I am, the far greater ſort of Chriſtians (ſo called) are very groſs and carnal; at leaſt very low in their conceits of the ſtate of future happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Heaven is a word as little underſtood as Holineſs; and that, I am ſure, is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt myſtery in the world; it would be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to run thorow the particular various apprehenſions of men in this matter, and indeed impoſſible to know them. The common ſort of people underſtand either juſt nothing by Heaven but a glorious name; or at beſt, but a freeneſs from bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly torment: As, nothing of Hell affects them, but that dreadful word <hi>fire;</hi> ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Heaven, but the comfortable word,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100587:105"/> 
               <hi>Reſt</hi> or ſafety. Others, it may be, think there is ſomething poſitive in Heaven, and they dream of an honourable, eaſic, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant life, free from ſuch kind of toyls, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, pains, perſecutions, reproaches, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuries which men are ſubject to in this life: This is a true notion, but much below the nature of that happy ſtate; others are yet more highly affected with the words of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Glorious,</hi> and ſeem to be much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed with them; but are like men in a maze or wonderment, that admire ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that they underſtand not, and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together confounded in their own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of it: As if a man ſhould be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily taken with ſuch a fine name as <hi>Arabia the happy,</hi> and by a blind fervor of mind ſhould deſire to go and viſit it. Others riſe higher yet in their apprehenſions of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and look upon it as a holy ſtate; but that holineſs is negative, <hi>viz.</hi> a perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from ſin, and all temptations to it: And indeed this is a precious conſideration, and that wherein many a weary ſoul finds much reſt. But yet this amounts not to the life of Angels; it is a lower conſideration of Heaven, than what our Saviour here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us with. The ſtate of the glorified Saints, ſhall not only be a ſtate of freedom
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100587:106"/> from temporal pains, or eternal pains, or a freedom from ſpiritual pains and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; but a ſtate of perfect <hi>poſitive holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pure light, ardent love, ſpiritual liberty, holy delights;</hi> when all created good ſhall perfectly vaniſh, all created love ſhall be ſwallowed up, the ſoul ſhall become of a moſt God-like diſpoſition, ſhining forth in the glory that he ſhall put upon it glorying in nothing but the bleſſed God, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, in his divine Image and perfections, and wrapt up entirely into his infinite fulneſs to all eternity: Which hath made me oft-times to nauſeat, and indeed to blame the poor low deſcriptions of the Kingdom of Heaven which I have found in Books and Sermons, for too drye, yea and groſs; which do deſcribe Heaven princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally as a place, and give it ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of beauty, firmneſs, ſecurity, light and ſplendor, pleaſant ſociety, good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, as they think will moſt commend an earthly habitation. True indeed, the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture is pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend ſo far to our weak capacities, as to deſcribe that glorious ſtate to us by ſuch things as we do beſt underſtand, and are apt to be moſt taken with, and do moſt gratifie our ſenſes in this world; as a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100587:106"/> Paradiſe, a glorious City, a Crown,</hi> an <hi>Inheritance, &amp;c.</hi> But yet it is not the will of God that his enlightened people ſhould reſt in ſuch low notions of eternal life: For in other places God ſpeaks of the ſtate of glory, according to the nature and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of it, and not according to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our underſtanding; and deſcribes it at another rate, calling it the <hi>Life of Angels;</hi> as here, <hi>the beholding of God</hi> (Mat. 5. 8.) <hi>a coming unto the meaſure of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 13. Gods being <hi>All</hi> things in us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28. It is called a <hi>Knowing of God, and of his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 17. 3.

It is the character of wicked and godleſs men, that they ſet up, and drive a trade for themſelves; live in a way diſtinct from God, as though they had no dependence upon him; they love the world with a predominant love; they enjoy creature-comforts in a groſs, unſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual manner, they dwell upon the dark ſide of their mercies, they treaſure up riches, not only in their <hi>cheſts,</hi> but in their <hi>hearts;</hi> they feed upon the creature, not only with their <hi>bodyes,</hi> but their very <hi>ſouls</hi> do feed upon them; and thus, in a word, they live <hi>without God in the world:</hi> All this is no wonder; for that which is of the earth, muſt needs be earthly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 31. is it not a monſtrous thing, that a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

Well might the Apoſtle ſay indeed, that to dye was <hi>gain. Phil.</hi> 1. 21. For, is not this gain, to exchange an <hi>animal</hi> life, for an <hi>Angelical</hi> life; a life which is in ſome ſenſe common to the very beaſts with us, for that which in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100587:109"/> ſome ſenſe may be called the life of God? For as the bleſſed and holy God lives upon his own infinite and ſelf-ſufficient fulneſs, without being beholden to any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out himſelf; ſo ſhall the Saints live upon him, and upon the ſelf-ſame infinite fulneſs, and ſhall not need any creature- contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Apoſtle indeed ſaith, That <hi>the laſt enemy to be deſtroyed is death,</hi> (1 Cor. 15. 26.) which is true of enemies without us; and it is true with reſpect to Chriſt, who ſhall make a general Reſurrection from the dead; for that is the proper mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: But it is true alſo, that the laſt enemy to be overcome within us, is the love of life: Therefore it is ſaid, That a man will part with any thing to keep his life, <hi>Job</hi> 2. 4. And we do generally excuſe the matter, and cry, Oh! life is ſweet, life is precious. It muſt be confeſt, and it may be granted; I believe that there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the ſoul to the body (ariſing from that dear and unconceivable union that God himſelf hath made of them) which is purely natural (ſome ſay altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary for the maintaining of man in this complex ſtate) and not in it ſelf ſinful: Poſſibly there may not be found a man upon earth ſo holy and mortified, in
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100587:109"/> whom this is not found; certainly it is the laſt hinderance to be removed out of the way of our perfect happineſs. This, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it ſelf natural, yea neceſſary, &amp; without blame, yet in the inordinateneſs of it, ordinarily, if not conſtantly, becomes ſinful. I count him the moſt perfect man in the world, who loves not his own life with an inordinate, ſinful love: who loves it only in God, and not with a creature-love diſtinct from God. There are two wayes whereby this natural and lawful love of life becomes ſinful, <hi>viz. immoderateneſs,</hi> and <hi>inordinateneſs Immoderateneſs</hi> is when men love their lives at that rate, that they are filled with unreaſonable and diſtracting fears, cares, and thoughts about them, when the whole <hi>buſineſs</hi> of life is almoſt nothing elſe but a ſtudiouſneſs to preſerve the <hi>Being</hi> of life. <hi>Inordinateneſs</hi> is when men, though they do not love their lives at that exceſſive rate, yet do love life as a creature-good, not in God, nor in order to him, but love it for it ſelf, as ſomething out of God: Every carnal man in the world is guilty of the latter; and I doubt but few Saints altogether free from the guilt of it. Now that this immoderate love of life ought to be ſubdued in Chriſtians, all
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100587:110"/> men almoſt will grant: If any will not grant it, we can eaſily prove it from the command of God, <hi>Mat. 6. 25. Take no thought for your life,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 15. <hi>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.</hi> Both which words, in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourableſt interpretation that can be given of them, do in the judgment of all, forbid immoderation: N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y, a meer Philoſopher would enforce this from meer moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiderations, which I cannot now ſtand upon. But this inordinate love of life, as it is a more ſecret, ſticking evil, a more refined corruption, is harder to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and men are loath to be convinced of the evil of it. Now this particular diſtinct loving of life, not as in God, but in it ſelf, as a creature-good, is clearly condemned in that firſt and great Commandment, <hi>Matth. 22. verſ. 37. Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind, q. d.</hi> God the Supreme, Infinite, Perfect, Original, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential, Self-ſufficient Good, is to be loved in the higheſt, and pureſt, and ſtrongeſt manner, that the heart of man is capable to love; and all other things only in him, and under him, and as being of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100587:110"/> him, and for his ſake. Let it be allowed that life is good; yet it muſt be added, that it is but a created-good: let it be allowed that life is comfortable; yet it muſt be acknowledged, that mans chiefeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and happineſs doth not ſtand in this animal. life, So then, life it ſelf is to be loved in God, who is the fountain and ſpring of life, it is to be loved in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a created good, and no otherwiſe: Now created goods are to be loved only in the Creator, as coming from him, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of him, as leading to him. Argue the caſe a little, thus; The ſoul of man is allowed to love its body with which the great God hath matcht it; and to love union with this body, which union we call life: But this body being a creature, and a creature much inferiour to it ſelf, and much more ignoble than it ſelf, cannot in reaſon be judged to be the fit and adequate object of its ſtrongeſt and beſt affections: That muſt needs be ſomething more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than it ſelf, and that cannot be any thing in this world (for this world hath nothing ſo noble, ſo excellent in it as the ſoul of man) it muſt indeed be the Creator himſelf. Well, ſeeing God is the ſupreme, ſelf-ſufficient, perfect Good, he is to be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100587:111"/> loved with all the ſtre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gth and powers of the ſoul, ſingly and entirely: And the will of God, being God himſelf, is not only to be ſubmitted to, or reſted in, but to be choſen and loved above all created things; yea even above life it ſelf, the beſt of creatures. So then, if it be the will of God to call for our lives, we ought rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to give them up; becauſe we ought to love the will of God much more than our lives. I pray you drink in that notion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the will of God being pure, holy, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſhould not only be ſubmitted to, or reſted in, but even loved and choſen above all creatures: Now the will of God is not that only whereby he teacheth men, and preſcribes Laws to them, but that whereby he rules, and governs the world, and diſpoſes of men in any condition of life, or takes away their lives from them. The eternal fountain of goodneſs can ſend forth nothing but what is perfectly good: and that which is perfectly good, ought to be loved with an univerſal, pure, and (as far as poſſible) perfect love. This you will ſay, perhaps, is a high and a hard ſaying: But, let it not ſeem impoſſible, for a man to love his own life only in God, and in ſubordination to him; for this
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100587:111"/> God requires (and he requires not things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t, but in compariſon of me and my will: It is not then impoſſible; nay, you ſee it is a neceſſary duty, without which we cannot be Chriſts Diſciples. The Saints of old found it poſſible. Holy <hi>Paul</hi> gives this anſwer readily, <hi>Act. 21. 13. I am ready to dye at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>for the name of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> and <hi>Act. 20. 24. I count not my life dear unto me, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe with joy:</hi> It is witneſſed of the whole Army of the Saints, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 11. That <hi>they loved not their lives unto the death, i. e.</hi> they did not value them in reſpect of God and his truth. Neither let any one flatter himſelf, and ſay, Yea if I were called to dye for God, I would rather do it than deny him: For the will of God is as much to be eyed in his ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us by a natural death, as by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom; and a not giving up our lives to him at any time, is as truly to deny him and his will, as not to give them up at the ſtake, when we are called to it. Beſides, how ſhall we imagine that he that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to dye in his bed, ſhould be willing
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100587:112"/> to dye at a ſtake? Now this duty of being mortified to the love of this animal life, being ſo difficult, yet ſo neceſſary, and ſo noble; how doth it become every Saint to ſtudy to attain to this perfection! which, that we may, let us preſs upon our ſelves this Conſideration, this Doctrine, That the glorified Saints ſhall live as the Angels of God in Heaven. We know that if this body were broken down, this low life cut off, we ſhould live like Angels, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beholden any more to poor creatures for help or comfort, but ſhould be filled with the fulneſs of God, filled with his Image and Glory, and live upon him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely for evermore. Yea I may add, that this very living above our own lives, meerly at the will of God, is a participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Angelical Life even in this world: Therefore labour to be mortified to that love of this life which is here upon earth; yea be weary of it, yea almoſt aſhamed of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Shall we thus live the lives of the Angels, ſubſiſting in God, feaſting upon him, filled with him to all eternity? <hi>This may moderate our ſorrow which we conceive for the loſs of any created good,</hi> houſes, lands, husband, wife, children, &amp;c. yet a
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:100587:112"/> little while, and we ſhall not miſs them, ſhall not need them, ſhall not deſire them any more: The bleſſed Angels live a glorious life, and they have none of theſe; but are perfectly ſatisfied in the enjoyment of God alone: They have no wives nor children, yet they want none: And yet a little while, and we ſhall have none neither, neither ſhall we want them, having all things in the God of all things: They neither marry, nor are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in marriage; but are in conjunction with the Father, with love, and goodneſs, and truth it ſelf; and ſo they have no want of any thing. If you have no Candles left in the houſe, yet it is towards day-break, and the Sun will riſe upon you, and you ſhall need none, and yet have light enough too. In a word, learn to live beſide them whilſt you have them, and you will be the better able to live without them, when they are removed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I come now to the fifth and laſt Uſe that I ſhall make of this Doctrine; and oh that you and I may make this happy uſe of it! Shall the Saints be as the Angels of God in their way of living, in living upon God, and enjoying all happineſs in him alone for ever?

Though you are here impriſoned in a body of earth, and oft cumbred and clogg'd with bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and called to attend upon bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſities; yet, as far as this animal ſtate will permit, live upon God. Do not excuſe nor vindicate that low kind of earthly life; do not juſtifie your living below and beſides God, but ſtir up your ſelves to behold where your happineſs lies, and live not willingly below it. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a godly ſoul hath more than bare hope in this world: God the bleſſed, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and communicative good, hath not lockt up himſelf ſo far out of fight, but that he gives his people a comfortable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of him even whilſt they are in their Pilgrimage: and what <hi>Soloman</hi> ſaith of the life of the godly, he means it of their preſent life, <hi>Prov. 15. 24. The way of life is above to the wiſe:</hi> Their living not only ſhall be, but is now above; it is a high way of living: They are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a puny ſort of Mechanical Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that think and talk only of a Heaven to come, and dream of an happineſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100587:113"/> them, and diſtinct from them: The truly godly and God-like ſoul cannot ſo content himſelf, but being ſpirited and principled from above, is carryed out after the Infinite and Almighty Good, as a thing is carryed towards its centre; and haſtens into his embraces, as the Iron haſtens to the Loadſtone, and longs to be in conjunction with it. If therefore ye be from Heaven, live above all, above all earthly things: <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek the things that are above,</hi> Col. 3. 1.

Thus did they in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 32. who delighted in the Prophets eloquence, and in the Rhetorick of his Sermons as much as in a well tuned voice, and harmonious muſick: and ſo do thouſands in <hi>England,</hi> who read the Bible for the ſtyle or the ſtories ſake, and love to ſit under learned and elegant diſcourſes, more for <hi>accompliſhment,</hi> than for <hi>converſion:</hi> And ſwarms of Prieſts who preach themſelves, more than Chriſt Jeſus even in his own ordinances; as a proud Boy rides a horſe into the Market, to ſet forth himſelf more than his Maſters goods.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But there are many not ſo groſs as theſe, who do yet uſe ordinances in a way very groſs and unſpiritual, placing their devotion in them, and ſinking their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion into a ſettled courſe of hearing or praying; who will wait upon God (as they call it) at ſome ſet and ſolemn times, <hi>New Moons</hi> and <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> it may be evening
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100587:116"/> and morning; but Religion muſt not be too buſie with them, nor intermeddle in their ordinary affairs, or worldly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; it hath no place there; they do not count it a garment for every dayes wear.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And not only theſe, but even almoſt all men are too apt to ſeek reſt in duties and ordinances, or, at leaſt, to be pretty well ſatisfied with the work done, whether they have converſed with God there or no: Oh if you love your ſouls, ſeek you happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs higher! converſing with divine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, I confeſs, is honourable and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but it is too low a life for an immortal ſoul. <hi>Affirmatively,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let nothing ſatisfie you but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; take up with no pleaſure, no treaſure, no portion, no paradiſe; nay, no Heaven, no happineſs, below the infinite, ſupreme, and ſelf-ſufficient good. Let your eye be upon him, and his all-filling ſulneſs; let your deſire be unto him, and to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his name; follow hard after to know the Lord, and to enjoy the Father through his Son Jeſus Chriſt; let your fellowſhip be with the Father, and with the Son by the ſpirit, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3. O love the Lord all ye his Saints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 23. yea love
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100587:117"/> him with all your ſoul, and all your ſtrength, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37. yea and keep your ſelves alwayes in the love of God, <hi>Jude</hi> 21. perſevere and increaſe in the love of God; <hi>Keep your ſelves in the love of God.</hi> Oh ſweet duty! Oh amiable pleaſant task! Oh ſweet and grateſul command! Away ye crowd of creatures, I muſt keep my heart for my God: Away ye gawdy ſuitors, away ye glittering toyes, there is no room for you: My whole ſoul, if its capacity were ten thouſand times larger than it is, were too ſcant to entertain the ſupreme good, to let in infinite goodheſs and fulneſs. Oh charge it upon your ſelves with the greateſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence! love the Lord O my ſoul, keep thy ſelf in the love of God; let the love of God conſtrain you, and keep your ſelves under the moſt powerful conſtraints of it. In a word, live upon God as upon uncreated life it ſelf; drink at the fountain, ſeed upon infinite fulneſs; depend upon Almighty Power, refer your ſelves to unſearchable wiſdom, and unbounded love; ſee nothing but God in the creature, taſte nothing but God in the world, delight your ſelves in him; long for communion with him, and communications from him, to receive of his fulneſs grace for grace. Then do we
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100587:117"/> live moſt like Angels, when we live moſt purely in God, and find all the powers of our ſouls ſpending themſelves upon him, and our ſelves, our life, and all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of it flowing from him, and again ſwallowed up in him. But becauſe we are yet in the body, I ſhall explain it in theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Converſe with God in all your Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellencies.</hi> I bade you before not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with theſe; now, I ſay, converſe with God in theſe. Thus do the Angels, they know nothing that they have of their own, they enjoy nothing diſtinct from God: They are excellent creaturs, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in knowledge, power, holineſs, &amp;c. yet they enjoy all their excellencies in God, and aſcribe them all to him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 12. And ſo let us labour to do.</p>
            <p n="1">1. View your ſelves, not in your own particular Beings, but in the Eſſence of God; look upon your ſelves as being and ſubſiſting in the midſt of an Infinite Eſſence, in which the whole Creation is, as it were, wrapt up, and doth ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And what ever excellency you find in your ſouls or bodyes, look not upon it as your own; maintain not a <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> a diſtinction of intereſts be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ween God and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100587:118"/> your ſelves; but look upon all as Gods, and enjoy it in him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When you find your ſelves tempted to caſt a fond and unchaſte look upon the beauty, ſtrength, activity, or temper of your own bodyes, upon the ingenuity, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, conſtancy, courage, compoſedneſs of your own ſouls; take heed of ſettling into a ſelfiſh admiration of any of them, but enjoy them in God, and ſay, This, O my body, this, O my ſoul, is no other than the portraicture of the Bleſſed God; theſe created excellencies are broken beams of the infinite, unſpotted, uncreated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections! <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 23, 24. Having once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to this, we ſhall no longer covet to be admired, deſire to be commended, fret at being undervalued; I mean not in a ſelfiſh manner, but rather break out in a ſpiritual paſſion with the pſalmiſt, <hi>Oh that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, and for his wonderful works in the children of men!</hi> Pſal. 107. 8.</p>
            <p>3. Nay, let me add, when you find your ſelves ready to put your own ſtamp upon Gods beſt coin; to look upon ſupernatural gifts and graces with a ſinful, ſelfiſh admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, remember that you have them only in Chriſt Jeſus, and enjoy them in your
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100587:118"/> head; labour to enjoy grace it ſelf only in Chriſt; as the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal. 2. 20. I, yet not I but Chriſt in me: I laboured, yet not I, but the grace of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 10. So ought we to glory; I believe, I love, I am patient, penitent, humble; yet not I, but the grace of God that is with me, Chriſt Jeſus that dwelleth in me. And indeed a godly man who thus lives at the very height of his own Being, yea and above it too, knows beſt how to reverence himſelf, yea and to love himſelf too, and yet without any ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love: For he loves himſelf in God, and his own endowments as divine orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>2. Converſe with God, and live upon him in the excellencies of all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in all your creature-enjoyments. We cannot live without creatures, as the Angels do indeed; but let us come as near them as we can, which is by living above creatures: place your happineſs in God, and your hearts upon him; labour to find God all things to you, and in you, and to be filled with his fulneſs; labour to get your underſtandings filled with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, your wills filled with his divine will, your hearts filled with his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſs and ſweetneſs, your memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100587:119"/> filled with the remembrance of his name, your whole ſouls filled with his holy and pure Image, filled with the fruits of his holy Spirit: Nay, let theſe very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes be filled not only with his good creatures; but more eſpecially with his good will in the creatures. It is ſaid indeed of the ſenſual Epicures of the world, that their <hi>bellyes are filled</hi> with Gods <hi>hid treaſure, i. e.</hi> with rare and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious delicacies: But how much better doth God fill the bellyes of his Saints with his hid treaſures, when he feedeth them with his divine favour, and <hi>dippeth his hand</hi> with them <hi>in the diſh?</hi> This is meat within meat, which the Saints eat of, which other men, though they feed at the ſame Table, know not of. The glorified Saints ſhall be ſatisfied wholly and perfectly with the Divine Image, ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning gloriouſly on them, and in them; to which purpoſe that of the Pſalmiſt may be accommodated, <hi>Pſal. 17. ult. When I awake, &amp;c.</hi> Well, we cannot be ſo ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this life, it ſeems; however, though we cannot be ſo ſatisfied with it; yet let us not be ſatisfied without it, nor ſatisfied with any thing beſides it: Reſolve, holy ſoul, well, if I muſt not be fully ſatisfied with
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100587:119"/> the Image of my heavenly Father till I awake, I will lie down and fall aſleep hungry as I am then; for I will not fill my mouth with chaff, nor my ſoul with <hi>the husks that the Swine do eat.</hi> But, in the mean time, get what you can of God out of creature-enjoyments.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Enjoy all things for God:</hi> And that theſe two wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe all for him:</hi> Thoſe riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, intereſts, friends, which are <hi>cloggs upon the heels</hi> of others, let them be as <hi>heels</hi> to you to carry you Heaven-ward; let your ſouls be <hi>winged</hi> with thoſe very enjoyments, wherewith the <hi>wings</hi> of others are <hi>pinioned;</hi> and that which is fewel to their worldly luſts, let it be as fewel to feed and nouriſh your ſpiritual love. To uſe what we have for God, is the only way of not abuſing it: This is one way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying all for God, to uſe all for him; and yet there is ſomething higher in that phraſe of enjoying all for God, than this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Value no creature-comfort any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than as it leads to God:</hi> And this in a double ſenſe too. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Value things to be good only by this, by their leading you unto God. <hi>Perfectum in ſuo genere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſura
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100587:120"/> reliquorum:</hi> Now God being the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and Infinite Good, any thing is ſo far good, as it leads to the enjoyment of him: Now the enjoyment of God is only in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like to him; Holineſs is his Image: So then, every thing is good that tends to ſanctification, and to make men partakers of a Divine Nature. We are uſually miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the true notion of good and evil, of mercies and judgements; judging ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the taſte, as fooliſh Patients do; but Gods thoughts are not as our thoughts. Meaſure all things by the proportion they bear, and the tendency they have to the Supreme Good; and call not any thing evil that brings nearer to him, nor any thing good that draws off from him. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> When you have found a thing that is really good, tending and leading to the chief good, and to the poſſeſſion of him; labour to enjoy it, and rejoyce in it only under this notion, as ſuch; when you love it, let it be with a pure ſpiritual love; and ſo order your delight in it, that it may be ſaid, you do rather rejoyce in the end of it, than in the enjoyment of it.</p>
            <p>2. Another way of living upon God in the creature, is, <hi>To enjoy all things as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of him. Every good and perfect gift
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:100587:120"/> is from above.</hi> Every beam of created light floweth out of the <hi>Father of light,</hi> James 1. 17. When the bleſſed and glorious God framed this ſtately fabrick of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible world, becauſe there was nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the world than himſelf, he was pleaſed to copy out himſelf in it, and to ſpread his own infinite perfections over it, and thorow it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. ſo that every particular good is a bloſſom of the firſt goodneſs; every created excellency is a dark draught of God, and a broken beam of this infinite Sun of Righteouſneſs. Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted life, beauty, wiſdom, goodneſs, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are nothing elſe but effluxes, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ebullitions out of the ſelf-ſufficient fountain, ſcant communications made of himſelf, from untreated life, eſſential wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, univerſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which you find here below, not ſo much as the perfections of this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Being, but as they are ſo many drops riſen out of the fountain of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, in whom they all meet, and are concentred. It it well expreſt by one, <hi>In a
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100587:121"/> particular Being, love the univerſal good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> let the whole world be as the Garden of God to you, where every creature is a flower, from which you may ſuck ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the divine ſweetneſs. Alas, at what a low and ſenſual rate do we live, when we rejoyce in creatures, either as they are <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,</hi> or as they are <hi>ours;</hi> whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed neither of theſe is true: For they are not excellent, but God is excellent in them: And how can we call any thing our own, when God made both us and all things for himſelf? On how injurious is it to the bleſſed God, when we rob him of his own perfections that he hath imprinted upon the creature, by loving it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in it not as in him, but as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſtinct from him! Nay, we are then injurious to our ſelves, as we ſhall ſee by and by. Labour to enjoy, and to converſe with God in the creatures. <hi>O how precious are the thoughts of thee unto me,</hi> O God! cryed <hi>David</hi> when he had been meditating of the creatures excellencies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 17. Labour to abſtract your minds from terrene things even in the enjoyment of them, and call upon your ſelves to love, and live, and feed upon God in them; live not upon the dark ſide of your mercies, but upon the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:100587:121"/> repreſentations of God in them. Is there any thing good? Oh this is a taſte of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Goodneſs! Is there any thing ſweet? Oh how ſweet is the God that made it ſo! Is there any thing lovely? it is a picture of him whoſe name is <hi>Love.</hi> Is any thing firm, ſtable, laſting? it is a ſhadow of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious eſſence, with whom there is no ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of change. Have you any thing ſtrong? it ariſes out of that God with whom is <hi>everlaſting ſtrength.</hi> Doth any creature give reſt, eaſe, refreſhment? it ſprings out of the All ſatisfying fulneſs of God. In a word, labour to climb up by every created excellency, as by ſo many beams to the Father of lights: let all the world be to you as Gods Temple, and be ready to ſay of every place, as <hi>Jacob<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How dreadful is this place; ſurely this is no other than the houſe of God!</hi> that God who runs thorow all created Beings, and from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves derives ſeveral prints of beauty and excellency all the world over: But eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially take heed of your own created-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, that they do not inſenſibly lead a way your hearts, and enſnare you into a ſinful, particular, diſtinct love of them; which is a ſin ſoon committed, hardly
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100587:122"/> diſcerned, and moſt hardly reformed. If any be freed from theſe inordinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ſure they are but few, and thoſe few have come dearly by it; as he ſaid in another caſe; <hi>with a great ſumm</hi> they have <hi>obtained this freedom;</hi> they have payed for it. not with the foreskins of the Philiſtines, but with the lives of what they ſo loved; there being no way to cure this evil diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but cutting off the member infected with it, the part that it fed upon. As a branch of this head, let me add, labour to <hi>live upon God in the excellencies of other men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> value them and all their accompliſhments only in God, as he that did <hi>diligere Deum habitantem in Auguſtino:</hi> Admire God, and enjoy God in them: Where ever you ſee wiſdom, goodneſs, ingenuity, holineſs, juſtice, or any other accompliſhment: ſay, Here and there is God. And this is the honeſt way of making our ſelves Maſters of whatever is another mans, and enjoying it, as truly as he himſelf doth; yea, as tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly as if it were our own: when we behold all theſe beams, as coming from the ſame fountain of lights, and do love them all in him with an univerſal love. This is the rare Art of having nothing, yet poſſeſſing
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100587:122"/> all things, of being rich, though one have nothing: and of being wiſe, though one know nothing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The laſt way of living upon God in the creature, is, <hi>To taſte and feed upon the love of God in them;</hi> not only his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bounty, but his ſpecial love in Chriſt. The good will of God gives a ſweet reliſh to every morſel, as I hinted before. Even in the midſt of all your delightful, pleaſant, ſweet enjoyments, let your ſouls be more affected with this, than with them; let this be as the <hi>Manna</hi> lying upon the top of all your outward comforts, which your ſpirits may gather up, and feed upon. But this I toucht upon before; therefore I ſhall add no more concerning it. Thus I have ſhewed you how you may imitate the life of Angels in living upon God, even whilſt you live in the body. To this I may add another particular or two.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Converſe with God, and live upon him in all his Ordinances:</hi> Let communion with God be your drift in every duty, and the very life, and ſoul, and ſweetneſs of every ordinance. You never read of a ſoul more thirſty after ordinances, than <hi>David,</hi> as might appear abundantly: yet if you look
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100587:123"/> well into the expreſſions, you will find that it was not ſo much after them, as after God in them; not after the dead letter, but after the living God, <hi>Pſa. 4. 2. 2. My ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God;</hi> and <hi>Pſal. 84. 2. My heart and my fleſh cryeth out for the living God.</hi> Let the Word preacht or read be as a voyce from Heaven talking you; let your conſerence be a comment upon that Word; let meditation be as a kind of bringing down God into your ſouls; and prayer as a raiſing up of your ſouls into God; nothing but faith and love put into phraſes. And ſo of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Converſe with God in all his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences;</hi> proſperity, adverſity, plenty, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury, health, ſickneſs, peace and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity. This is a large Theme: But as to proſperity, I have ſpeken ſomething a ready, under that head of converſing with God in creature enjoyments: As for adverſity, I have ſaid much more in a large diſcourſe, to deſcribe and commend the Art of converſing with God in affictions: Briefly at this time, converſe not with loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wants, afflictions, but with God in them; and that not only with the juſtice,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100587:123"/> righteouſneſs, ſeverity and ſoveraignty of God in them, but with the goodneſs and mercy of God in them: They are dark Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, we had not need to dwell all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on the dark ſide of them. If all the wayes of the Lord towards his people be <hi>mercy and truth,</hi> Pſa. 25. 10 then his rougheſt and moſt uncouth wayes are ſo 100: If God be wholly love, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 8. then his very corrections proceed not from hatred: If it be his name to be good, and to do good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 68. where have we learnt then to call his afflicting Providences Evils, and to divide evil, which is but one, even as God is one, into <hi>culpae</hi> and <hi>paenae,</hi> ſin and affliction? ſurely we ſpeak as men: And if God call them ſo, he ſpeaks after the manner of men, as he often doth. If the governing will of God be pure, perſect, and infinitely good and righteous, ought we not to converſe with it in a free and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner; yea and to love it too? In a word, pore not upon creature-changes, nor the uncertain wheels of motion that are turning up and down, we know not how, nor how oft; but fix your ſouls upon that All-ſeeing eye, that unbounded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that unſearchable and infinite
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100587:124"/> goodneſs that derives it ſelf thorow the whole univerſe, and ſits in all the wheels of motion, governing all the ſtrange mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the creatures in a wonderful and powerful manner, and carrying them all in their ſeveral Orbs to one laſt and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed end.</p>
            <p>Thus imitate the Angelical life, even whilſt you are in the body; converſe with God in ſelf-excellencies, in creature-excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, Ordinances, Providences: And yet labour to be more like them ſtill, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract your mind from all theſe, and all material and ſenſible things, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God without the help of any creature, I mean in the ſpirit, and by a ſecret feeling of his Almighty Goodneſs, and the energy of grace, and the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of a divine life, in your ſouls. In a word, if you would taſte of Heaven whilſt you are upon Earth, labour above all things for a true conjunction of your hearts with God, in a ſecret feeling of his goodneſs, and a reciprocation of love to him; and to find the holy and bleſſed God exerciſing his grace and power upon all the faculties of your ſouls, and rendring them like unto himſelf; and all theſe powers of the ſoul
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:100587:124"/> mutually ſpending themſelves upon him freely and entirely, as upon the chiefeſt good, which is their proper and full object. Seeing the Saints in glory ſhall be like unto the Angels of God in their way of living in and upon God alone, receive, I pray, this Exhortation, which I have ſo largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, and labour to begin that life as far as you can, upon Earth. Is there not reaſon for ſuch an Inference? Doth it not now flow naturally from the Doctrine? If you think it do not, I will add two or three particulars to ſtrengthen this Inference; or at leaſt to clear it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is highly reaſonable that we begin to be that which we expect to be for ever, to learn that way of living in which we hope to live to all eternity: So that I infer upon as ſtrong ground as the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 3. He that hath this hope purifieth himſelf, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If this be the life of Angels, then it is the higheſt and nobleſt life that any created Being is capable of. As by the <hi>bread of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> and the <hi>tongue of Angels,</hi> the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent food, and the moſt excellent lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, is underſtood in Scripture; ſo muſt we underſtand this life of Angels. Now it is very ſuitable to the reaſonable ſoul, that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:100587:125"/> immortal, noble Being, to aim at the higheſt and nobleſt life: See <hi>Mat. 16. 26. What ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This ſhall not only be our life in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but it ſelf is ſomething of Heaven, a beginning of Heaven. This life is not a thing really diſtinct from life eternal, <hi>Joh. 17. 3. this is life eternal, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 13. <hi>Ye have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</hi> Therefore we read of eternal life abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in men, and not abiding in them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3 15. So alſo <hi>Joh. 6. 54.

So much as we enjoy of God in the creature, we do not loſe with it: and that which we do not ſo enjoy, we deſerve to loſe. This then is the ſecure and honourable life; in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of which the life of a Prince is but a wallowing in the mire. <hi>Lord give us ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more this bread,</hi> and hearts to feed upon it!
